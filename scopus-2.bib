abstract={The impact of Online Social Networks (OSNs) on human lives is foreseen to be very large with unprecedented amount of data and users. OSN users share their ideas, photos, daily life events, feelings and news. Since OSNs’ security and privacy challenges are more potential than ever before, it is necessary to enhance the protection and filtering approaches of OSNs contents. This paper explores OSNs’ threats and challenges, and categorize them into: account-based, URL-based and content-based threats. In addition, we analyze the existing protection methods and highlight their limitations and weaknesses. Based on that, we propose a comprehensive, user-level, proactive and real-time OSNs’ protection system, called Hybrid Real-time Social Networks Protector (HRSP). HRSP has three components; a user-level security protocol and two classification models. The protocol defines a structure for OSN’s cryptographic services, including encryption, access control and users’ authentication. The classification models employ machine learning, black lists, white lists and users’ feedback, in order to classify URLs into: Benign, Risk and Inappropriate classes, and contents into: Benign, Hate speech and Inappropriate classes. We constructed two data sets of 150,000 URLs and 22,000 tweets to build and test the two classification models. Results show an overall accuracy of 93.2% for the URL model and 84.4% for the content model, while the protocol implementation produces compatible size and time overhead. The components of HRSP are integrated and have compatible design with OSN platforms. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The once-booming but scandal-ridden peer-to-peer lending industry robbed hundreds of thousands of retail investors of their life savings in the past several years. This paper examines the possibility and feasibility of identifying P2P lending firm non-normal business operation and the exits with the nature of frauds by using company's ownership structure characteristics. This paper adopts the penetrated shareholder compositions of P2P lending firms to construct their shareholding Ego-networks, and proposes an Ego-network clustering approach to describe and compare ownership structures of P2Ps. We find that there are two kinds of groups: the majority is that with a small amount of shareholders spread in shallow equity levels, while the minority is that with more shareholders, deeper equity structures and more complex cross-holding relationships. This paper mainly studies whether equity structural characteristics can be used to detect the frauds of P2P firms. Hence, classification algorithms are used, and logistic regression models with different P2P shareholding Ego-network characteristics are also employed to complete and explain the identification results. We confirm that firm's ownership structure can provide useful information for fraud detection. For example, P2P lending companies which are held by fewer direct and indirect shareholders, have fewer connections among related equity systems, and are held by shareholders with lower centralities in ownership Ego-networks are more likely to non-normally exit because of fraud risk events. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Telecommunication service providers (telcos) are exposed to cyber-attacks executed by compromised IoT devices connected to their customers’ networks. Such attacks might have severe effects on the attack target, as well as the telcos themselves. To mitigate those risks, we propose a machine learning-based method that can detect specific vulnerable IoT device models connected behind a domestic NAT, thereby identifying home networks that pose a risk to the telcos infrastructure and service availability. To evaluate our method, we collected a large quantity of network traffic data from various commercial IoT devices in our lab and compared several classification algorithms. We found that (a) the LGBM algorithm produces excellent detection results, and (b) our flow-based method is robust and can handle situations for which existing methods used to identify devices behind a NAT are unable to fully address, e.g., encrypted, non-TCP or non-DNS traffic. To promote future research in this domain we share our novel labeled benchmark dataset. © 2020},

abstract={Historically communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) technologies were designed independently and operated in a siloed fashion. As 4D trajectory-based operations (TBO), connected aircraft, system wide information management (SWIM) systems, and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are fast becoming reality, an aviation internet, that will enable fast, safe, secure, and cost-effective information sharing across CNS and air traffic management (ATM) domains is emerging as a necessary approach to cope with the challenge of ATM in complex operational environments.The aviation internet will leverage commercial Internet Protocols (IP) and information security technologies to establish an internetworking capability across CNS functions for both manned and unmanned aircraft. Both United States and European Union have set the goal of implementing an interoperable IP-based aviation network around the 2028 timeframe. As more and more aviation stakeholders are eager to contribute to the aviation internet standardization and validation, a practical and systematic transition plan that will orchestrate aviation stakeholders' efforts to achieve common mission objectives is crucial to the success of aviation internet transformation.In support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) CNS strategy, we first take a systems engineering approach to investigate key practical aspects of the whole lifecycle of the aviation internet transition, including technical standards suitability, regulatory and policy support, acquisition and investment decision process, business model, cost/benefit, market offerings, necessary validation, and implementation activities. Based on the investigation, we then identify technical, regulatory, and programmatic risks and corresponding mitigations, and provide technical feedback to the standardization groups. Finally, we present an action plan for the aviation industry stakeholders to ensure a successful transition from today's closed custom network to tomorrow's IP-based aviation internet. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The pattern of decreased prefronto-thalamic connectivity and increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity has been consistently documented in schizophrenia. However, whether this thalamo-cortical abnormality pattern is of genetic predisposition remains unknown. The present study for the first time aimed to investigate the common and distinct characteristics of this circuit in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected siblings who share half of the patient's genotype. Totally 293 participants were recruited into this study including 94 patients with schizophrenia, 96 their healthy siblings, and 103 healthy controls scanned using gradient-echo echo-planar imaging at rest. By using a fine-grained atlas of thalamus with 16 sub-regions, we mapped the thalamocortical network in three groups. Decreased thalamo-prefronto-cerebellar connectivity was shared between schizophrenia and their healthy siblings, but increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity was only found in schizophrenia. The shared thalamo-prefronto-cerebellar dysconnectivity showed an impressively gradient reduction pattern in patients and siblings comparing to controls: higher in the controls, lower in the patients and intermediate in the siblings. Anatomically, the decreased thalamic connectivity mostly centered on the pre-frontal thalamic subregions locating at the mediodorsal nucleus, while the increased functional connectivity with sensorimotor cortices was only observed in the caudal temporal thalamic subregion anchoring at the dorsal and ventral lateral nuclei. Moreover, both decreased thalamo-prefronto-cerebellar connectivity and increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity were related to clinical symptoms in patients. Our findings extend the evidence that the decreased thalamo-prefronto-cerebellar connectivity may be related to the high genetic risk in schizophrenia, while increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity potentially represents a neural biomarker for this severe mental disorder. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Considering the high-end equipment development data may face the risk of sensitive data disclosure during data mining and data sharing, the GAN for data hyposensitization is used. Experiments are carried out on randomly generated Gauss data sets. By comparing the statistical characteristics of the original data and hyposensitization data, it is proved that the data hyposensitization method based on GAN can effectively realize the data security, data utility and cost controllability. Finally, on the Yeast dataset, the desensitized data output by the GAN also performs well in real-world datasets, which can accurately predict the classification of Yeast, providing a new idea for the management and analysis of high-end equipment development data. © 2020, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

abstract={Cloud computing is a trend in technology that stores and retrieves valuable data via worldwide distributed servers. Various virtual machines (VMs) share the same physical resources across these services; these VMs are called Co-VMs. The shared physical resources pose a major challenge to the users. A tool may belong to both professional organizing as well as unknown attackers. There's no guarantee, from a cloud user's viewpoint, that the co-resident VMs are trusted. Shared resources establish the unplausible privacy and ideal separations where it paves the gate for the invasion of co-residents, where a VM invades other co-resident VM. Here an improved relevance vector machine with fuzzy c-means clustering (IRVM-FCM) depending defense systems are discussed through reducing the Co-location DOS invaders by assuring it hardening for attackers to make an attack. By this method, primarily, the attacker behavior is verified through using the previously selected server first (PSSF) VM allocation strategy. After, the partial labeling is achieved using FCM Clustering system; it is used to categorize users as legal or malicious. After that, an IRVM classification scheme is discussed for varying all users with three categories like high risk (i.e. malicious), medium risk (i.e. uncertain), and low risk (genuine). Within IRVM, the Mosquito Flying behavior depending on the swarm intelligence optimization approach used to optimize the kernel functions of parameters to enhance the training methods. Finally, Stackelberg game theory is adapted to hike the price of launching a new VM hence diminish the possibility of a Co-R DOS threat in cloud servers. The experimental implementation with Cloudsim results displays that the discussed IRVM-FCM method attained highperformance results compared to previous VM allocation schemes. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In infrastructure-as-a-service environments, Cloud data centers employ virtualization technology to host various applications in virtual machines (VMs) and enable application isolation on shared physical resources. Additionally, live VM migration has been adopted to perform load balancing by moving VMs across distinct hosts. However, co-located VMs that show significant positive correlations on their CPU utilization patterns are at a higher risk of triggering overloading events and incurring performance degradation, even when their host is operating below its critical limits. To address this problem, a VM consolidation mechanism inspired by host-switching behaviors in symbiotic associates is proposed in this paper. In the proposed mechanism, hosts and VMs in Cloud data centers represent symbionts in an ecosystem. Two heuristic functions, inspired by host susceptibility and symbiotic coefficient among symbionts, are proposed to yield better resource utilization via VM consolidations. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can achieve reductions in both energy consumption and service level agreement violations of Cloud data centers. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed many application domains with realtime, continuous, automated control and information transmission. The smart grid is one such futuristic application domain in execution, with a large-scale IoT network as its backbone. By leveraging the functionalities and characteristics of IoT, the smart grid infrastructure benefits not only consumers, but also service providers and power generation organizations. The confluence of IoT and smart grid comes with its own set of challenges. The underlying cyberspace of IoT, though facilitates communication (information propagation) among devices of smart grid infrastructure, it undermines the privacy at the same time. In this paper we propose a new measure for quantifying the probability of privacy leakage based on the behaviors of the devices involved in the communication process. We construct a privacy stochastic game model based on the information shared by the device, and the access to the compromised device. The existence of Nash Equilibrium strategy of the game is proved theoretically. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the privacy stochastic game model. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the most recent trends in IT division is cloud computing (CC). It is an appropriated processing condition which has committed registering assets gotten to whenever from anyplace. In the present time, user keeps a high measure of information on cloud and even share a great deal of information, and thus, it is important to utilize safety efforts so that there is no risk to any of the client's information. To furnish an abnormal state of security with the fast headway of Internet, numerous devices and systems are being utilized. In this study, a Hybrid Adaptive algorithm is developed for the security on Cc. The proposed adaptive machine learning algorithm is the combination of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with adaptive split algorithm (ASA). RNN is one of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, which is utilized to classification purpose. The proposed hybrid adaptive algorithm is utilized to classify the data before the encryption process. Based on the process, the accuracy of the data is achieved and it requires less memory space only. After the data storage allocation, the design of end to end security framework is carried out. The main objective is to secure the data and eliminate the insider threats. The objective of the paper is to increase security by using adaptive split algorithm (ASA) for the transfer of data on cloud servers. The proposed hybrid adaptive method is implemented in JAVA platform and compared with the traditional methods, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM),respectively. Moreover, the statistical measures are evaluated Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F-measure, for the proposed and existing methods. © 2019 SERSC.},

abstract={In manufacturing, concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT) or Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) accelerate the development from traditional production facilities towards smart factories. Thereby, emerging digital technologies increasingly connect information networks with production processes, forming complex smart factory networks. Due to their reliance on information flows and the high degree of cross-linking, these networks are, in particular, vulnerable to availability risks caused by attacks and errors. To address this problem, we aim to identify and analyse availability threats by developing a modelling approach that depicts specific characteristics of smart factory networks. Based on modelling requirements derived from a literature review, we propose a modular Petri net approach. To iteratively revise and validate our model, we followed established evaluation principles and conducted evaluation rounds with industry experts and other researchers. To demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of our model, we simulated one real-world use case and two planned extensions of a mechanical engineering company. Our model depicts information-based dependencies within smart factory networks and allows for the simulation and analysis of threat propagation. Thereby, it enables both researchers and practitioners to identify critical network connections and components, serving as a basis for layout decisions and IT security mitigation measures. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

abstract={Bring Your Own Device is the phenomenon that gained popularity since 2009 when CISCO upon realising mobility of its employees adopted it. Also, IT consumerisation fuelled the adoption of BYOD. Employers allowing their employees to use their personally owned mobile devices is claimed to increase institutions production, reduce cost of IT device maintenance as well as reduced cost of buying IT devices. Even though, the list of BYOD benefits to both the employer and the employees are countless, BYOD has been seen by researchers and organizations that have adopted it as the risky program to the organisations' information security. Data loss, device and application management, mobile device loss and malicious application installation constitute the dominating BYOD risks globally. Like all technology enabled nations, many companies in Lesotho allow their employees to use their personally owned mobile devices to perform work related activities such as email access, company network access, storage of company sensitive information and many others, this trend is known as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). However, to ascertain their risk in relation to known challenges, an explorative qualitative study using a case study strategy was conducted with the main objective of assessing the information security risks presented by BYOD adoption to organizations in Lesotho. Open ended questions were developed and administered through face to face interviews and an online semi-structured interview using Survey Monkey. Interviews with 9 employees from X were conducted and questionnaires were shared with 25 IT employees of 5 different companies in Lesotho where 15 from 25 people responded to the online questions. The results obtained from the study illustrate where Lesotho as a country lies in relation to information security and adoption of BYOD in business operations. Risks identified include loss of confidential information, malware, mobile device loss, mingling of information and lack of BYOD policy. Based on the revealed landscape, BYOD information security risks and mitigations are discussed, and recommendations are presented on the best strategy that the organisations can adopt to handle BYOD information security risks within their boundaries. © 2020. the authors.

abstract={Frac Driven Interactions (FDI) have gained much attention, but like many past challenges in our industry, a solution is not far behind. The ability and willingness of operators to share information is at the core of advancing this solution. Not content to just shut-in our wells and "hope for the best" during nearby frac ops, we decided to pro-actively learn about FDIs and to apply the learnings to frac defense. Frac defense not only protects the primary well, it also helps to prevent asymmetrical fractures in the infill well. We provide methodology used to design and implement FDI defense. Additionally, we also show how we analyzed the results of the FDI defense to determine its success. In 2018, we had an opportunity to learn about FDI and documented those interactions, along with the analysis, in SPE 194349-MS. The original study was initiated to understand FDI and to ultimately determine appropriate mitigation. In this case study, we used the findings from the initial study to select suitable mitigation: pre-loading the primary well with water prior to offset fraccing operations. The study location is one that had previously experienced FDI from offset development wells. The primary wells had recovered quickly from the past FDI but due to an additional year of depletion, our research showed that recovery would probably be longer. The workflow covers well candidate selection, necessary personnel and equipment on location, and the risk analysis of the overall project. To monitor the effectiveness of mitigation after pre-loading, the team placed wellhead pressure sensors on pre-loaded primary wells, and primary wells in the adjacent pad. Sensors were installed on select vertical wells perforated through the target zones. In addition, wirelessy connected, high-pressure sensors were deployed on actively fraccing wells. All sensors were time-synced and monitored in real-time. Pressure results indicated that mitigation using the water pre-load method dampened FDIs. A successful application would manifest in pressure dampening and a reduction of recovery time. At the time of this writing, flowback operations are ongoing and one primary well recovered to pre-frac rates within one week. We anticipate a corresponding reduction of recovery time in the other wells. Most importantly, the infill well immediately offset from the primary is performing as good or better than the other infills in the same interval. This paper presents methods ad processes that offer a potential solution to identify candidates for fracture mitigation, and optimize project economics in a full section, multi-bench development. A novel aspect to the data is that all wells were wirelessly connected to the internet, time-synced with the atomic clock, and monitored in real-time. Time-synched pressure indicators immediately reveal the earliest signs of well-to-well communication across the entire field of active and passive wells. Pressure readings are reflective of FDIs allowing the operator to monitor, and proactively apply mitigation techniques in real-time. This process is known as "active well defense." However, due to certain limitations, we deployed a "passive well defense" where we injected water into the primary wells prior to frac operations. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

abstract={The current study looks at the impact of compliance to Shari'ah principles on the capital structure for Malaysian firms. Examination of impact of compliance is based on the classification by the Securities Commission of Malaysia. Given that the literature on adjustment tends to ignore non-linear models, the current study utilises Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNNs). Results are compared to conventional panel data regression models via performing a hold-out sample. Initial results confirm stability of the data allowing predictive ability. The results indicate that compliant firms tend to finance a greater portion of their financing imbalance via equities relative to non-compliant firms. This provides a strong indication towards compliant firms reducing overall risk taking where the financing pattern incorporates a greater aspect of risk sharing which is in-line with Shari'ah principles. In addition, two more factors are ranked as important in deciding compliant firms issue choice to resolve financial imbalance: profitability and size. The rest of the determinants have low impact on explaining net debt issues. Diagnostics for results provide evidence of lower RMSE and MSE for GRNNs for the training, testing and overall datasets. The potential benefit of this research allows managers and investors of Islamic capital markets to understand potential risk exposure and financing costs of compliant firms. Findings also provide a roadmap for development of a sustainable capital market model which has wider implications on a global scale. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Data confidentiality is put at risk on cloud platforms where multiple tenants share the underlying hardware. As multiple workloads are executed concurrently, conflicts in memory resource occur, resulting in observable timing variations during execution. Malicious tenants can intentionally manipulate the hardware platform to devise a covert channel, enabling them to steal the data of co-residing tenants. This paper presents two new microarchitectural covert channel attacks using the memory controller. The first attack allows a privileged adversary (i.e. process) to leak information in a native environment. The second attack is an extension to cross-VM scenarios for unprivileged adversaries. This work is the first instance of leakage channel based on the memory controller. As opposed to previous denial-of-service attacks, we manage to modulate the load on the channel scheduler with accuracy. Both attacks are implemented on cross-core configurations. Furthermore, the cross-VM covert channel is successfully tested across three different Intel microarchitectures. Finally, a comparison against state-of-the-art covert channel attacks is provided, along with a discussion on potential mitigation techniques. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={The world has changed. The global crisis related to the reduction of energy fossil resources, the reduction of potable water resources and the war for the control of energy sources are part of the causes which can lead to an intentional CBRNe (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and explosive) event together with the potential misuse of CBRNe agents, once considered to be solely the concern of the military, now needs to be considered also in the public domain. This kind of events could also be the consequence of an unintentional release of substances (i.e., an accident of a truck containing a Toxic Industrial Chemical), or of natural events like a tsunami or an earthquake. Thus, the high percentage of risk connected to their occurrence is clear. The aim of this paper is to analyze the CBRNe risk scenario and propose a standardized CBRNe joint approach for the establishment of “CBRNe technical tables” composed by cluster Entities from around Europe to manage the production of technologies, research, education and training activities in order to: (1) establish and maintain a roster of capabilities and facilities, and (2) organize to share expertise, and (3) plan to pool resources.

abstract={In multi-path routing schemes for payment-channel networks, Alice transfers funds to Bob by splitting them into partial payments and routing them along multiple paths. Undisclosed channel balances and mismatched transaction fees cause delays and failures on some payment paths. For atomic transfer schemes, these straggling paths stall the whole transfer. We show that the latency of transfers reduces when redundant payment paths are added. This frees up liquidity in payment channels and hence increases the throughput of the network. We devise Boomerang, a generic technique to be used on top of multi-path routing schemes to construct redundant payment paths free of counterparty risk. In our experiments, applying Boomerang to a baseline routing scheme leads to 40% latency reduction and 2 throughput increase. We build on ideas from publicly verifiable secret sharing, such that Alice learns a secret of Bob iff Bob overdraws funds from the redundant paths. Funds are forwarded using Boomerang contracts, which allow Alice to revert the transfer iff she has learned Bob’s secret. We implement the Boomerang contract in Bitcoin Script. © 2020, International Financial Cryptography Association.},

abstract={Embry Riddle Aeronautical University Prescott has designed and prototyped a small UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) detection, tracking, classification and identification system for UTM (UAS Traffic Management) compliance verification and UAM (Urban Air Mobility). This system primarily uses passive optical and acoustic sensors along with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems), or GPS (Global Positioning System) and ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast). The system design, known as Drone Net, is a network of passive sensors designed to cover a kilometer square area. In this paper we present the results of experiments to add an active RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) on the ground and active LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) on flight nodes (small UAS). System tests completed previously have shown feasibility for all passive optical and acoustic UTM and UAM. The point of the RADAR testing is to directly compare passive sensor networks to active to determine the value of each alone and to test the hypothesis that multi-modal active and passive sensing will be superior, but likely at higher cost than passive alone. Previously, we completed coordinated experiments with an EO/IR camera system and acoustic sensor network with an All-sky hemispherical six-camera system with resolution up to 12 million pixels to optimize detection and tracking. For some applications such as corporate campuses and Class-D airports, passive sensing alone might be sufficient and most cost effective, but for urban, military, and higher traffic Class-C and Class-B larger airports, we believe the combined multi-modal purpose-built sUAS RADAR integrated with optical and acoustic sensor networks will be most effective. Based upon our preliminary results presented herein, purpose built small RADAR with wide fields of view configured into an All-sky active system along with optical All-sky cameras and acoustic sensors are ideal for urban locations requiring the highest confidence in monitoring of combined UTM, UAM and GA (General Aviation) traffic. UTM will mostly be small UAS delivering parcels and must share airspace with UAM carrying passengers for short-hop transportation along with general aviation covering longer distances, but also entering urban airspace at airports. Clearly the airspace in urban locations is going to become much more congested, with new risk, but also new opportunity to improve transportation overall. The results we present here are a start at answering basic questions about multi-modal sensor effectiveness for urban navigation, both passive and active. In scenarios where sUAS and UAM may not have reliable GNSS or might not be UTM compliant, the ground detection, tracking and localization is most critical for assured urban airspace safety and security. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

abstract={Cloud computing is one of the most prominent technologies to host Internet services that unfortunately leads to an increased risk of data theft. Customers of cloud services have to trust the cloud providers, as they control the building blocks that form the cloud. This includes the hypervisor enabling the sharing of a single hardware platform among multiple tenants. Executing in a higher-privileged CPU mode, the hypervisor has direct access to the memory of virtual machines. While data at rest can be protected using well-known disk encryption methods, data residing in main memory is still threatened by a potentially malicious cloud provider. AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) claims a new level of protection in such cloud scenarios. AMD SEV encrypts the main memory of virtual machines with VM-specific keys, thereby denying the higher-privileged hypervisor access to a guest's memory. To enable the cloud customer to verify the correct deployment of his virtual machine, SEV additionally introduces a remote attestation protocol. This protocol is a crucial component of the SEV technology that can prove that SEV protection is in place and that the virtual machine was not subject to manipulation. This paper analyzes the firmware components that implement the SEV remote attestation protocol on the current AMD Epyc Naples CPU series. We demonstrate that it is possible to extract critical CPU-specific keys that are fundamental for the security of the remote attestation protocol. Building on the extracted keys, we propose attacks that allow a malicious cloud provider a complete circumvention of the SEV protection mechanisms. Although the underlying firmware issues were already fixed by AMD, we show that the current series of AMD Epyc CPUs, i.e., the Naples series, does not prevent the installation of previous firmware versions. We show that the severity of our proposed attacks is very high as no purely software-based mitigations are possible. This effectively renders the SEV technology on current AMD Epyc CPUs useless when confronted with an untrusted cloud provider. To overcome these issues, we also propose robust changes to the SEV design that allow future generations of the SEV technology to mitigate the proposed attacks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm enables an enormous network with millions of connected smart things to control almost all aspect of services. In an IoT scenario, self-configured things are dynamically connected in a universal network. The small things are broadly distributed in a real world model with some essential processing capacity and finite storage. Security, privacy and reliability are the most important pillars of the IoT infrastructure. It is challenging to share personal data, highly confidential professional data over a centralized system. The infrastructure itself is capable to provide the guarantee to transmit data safely. However, a special attention for the data along with data consistency is required. Cyber attackers and hackers mostly target the centralized systems. To triumph over these types of situations we propose a security based blockchain service along with some encryption approaches for a secure communication. The encryption and decryption is performed by a hash based secret key. Risk modelling and relative risk reduction also done to prevent attacks under a virtual private network in IoT domain. Before and after attack users also wish to know quality of service (QoS). We have developed a mobile application framework which provides desire output of a user from different aspect of QoS for better understanding. The MQTT broker performs as a negotiator to convey data between cloud consumer and cloud provider. In QoS monitoring section user get chance to reconsider availability, reliability and responsibility like QoS factors while recovering resources and actual resources before attacking system based on CPU utilization, cache status and storage. As per experiment result we able to recover 100% RAM, 97.64% CPU utilization and 78.7% storage using proposed encryption and algorithm on blockchain infrastructure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Humanitarian aid workers who try to provide aid to the most vulnerable populations in the Middle East or Africa are risking their own lives and safety to help others. The current lack of a collaborative real-time information system to predict threats prevents responders and local partners from developing a shared understanding of potentially threatening situations, causing increased response times and leading to inadequate protection. To solve this problem, this paper presents a threat detection and decision support system that combines knowledge and information from a network of responders with automated and modular threat detection. The system consists of three parts. It first collects textual information, ranging from social media, and online news reports to reports and text messages from a decentralized network of humanitarian staff. Second, the system uses deep neural network techniques to automatically detects a threat or incident and provide information including location, threat category, and casualties. Third, given the type of threat and the information extracted by the NER, a feedforward network proposes a mitigation plan based on humanitarian standard operating procedures. The classified information is rapidly redistributed to potentially affected humanitarian workers at any level. The system testing results show a high precision of 0.91 and 0.98 as well as an F-measure of 0.87 and 0.88 in detecting the threats and decision support respectively. We thus combine the collaborative intelligence of a decentralized network of aid workers with the power of deep neural networks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Development of reduction policies for products risking the health or the environment usually begins with the question of whether the most promising entry point is reducing production, distribution or consumption. We aim to answer this crucial question for bushmeat, a wildlife product whose unsustainable harvest threatens biodiversity and food security. We collected one of the largest data sets available on bushmeat commodity chains by interviewing 348 hunters, 202 bushmeat traders, 190 restaurant owners, and 985 consumers in 47 urban and rural settlements around Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. We examined 1) structural traits by network analyses and 2) disentangled the underlying economic, cultural, and nutritional motives for bushmeat utilization at the level of production (hunters), distribution (bushmeat traders), and consumption (households). We found that while economic drivers determined hunting, trading was associated with economic and cultural drivers and consumption was purely influenced by cultural habits. Bushmeat traders were promising candidates for effective regulation interventions, but held a small market share and the risk of displacement to other trading channels remains. Since cultural motives for consumption provide a key opportunity for large-scale behavioral changes, we propose consumers as the most effective point of entry for interventions. However, any such consumer level intervention should be supported by programs providing the remaining commodity chain actors with alternative livelihoods. Generally, interventions into the complex social-ecological system of wildlife commodity chains must consider interdependencies and require multi-actor approaches and monitoring to avoid displacement and diffusion effects and to guarantee a socially and ecologically sustainable change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: It might seem plausible to argue that effective monitoring of disaster data loss can help achieve progress in reporting to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) and the global targets of sustainable development goals and associated indicators. Nevertheless, with the lack of climate change and disaster data losses in the Arab region, the integration of risks associated with socio-economic dimensions at the wider scale of displacement is important to shape a regional understanding of resilience terminology and provides the means of translating it. The purpose of this paper is to identify the means of redefining “Resilience” in the Arab region context of climate change, conflict and displacement in association with the theoretical principles of the “fragile city”. Design/methodology/approach: In an attempt to achieve the SFDRR target (E) “substantially increase the number of countries with national and local DRR strategies by 2020,” this study investigates the use of the (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction) disaster resilience scorecard as a guiding principle for city-to-city (C2C) resilience-building knowledge exchange between Amman (Jordan) and Khartoum (Sudan). Findings: Facing similar urban challenges against disaster and violent conflict-protracted displacement, the study findings indicate that the C2C exchange program was useful in understanding the cities’ urban risk profiles, promoting dialogue among local governments and creating a culture of learning organizations for knowledge sharing on DRR governance and beyond. However, the applied resilience assessments overlooked the qualitative and socio-ecological understanding of climate change risk and human security principles among the most vulnerable groups of refugees and internally displaced persons in fragile settings. This is recommended to be integrated into building coherence for resilience across the 2015-2030 Global Agendas reporting and monitoring mechanisms, leaving “no one behind”. Originality/value: The C2C exchange program for Amman and Khartoum was an opportunity for understanding the cities’ urban risk profiles, addressing challenges and building “decentralized cooperation” beyond the cities’ institutional boundaries (UN Habitat, 2001), with recommendations for “selecting resilience indicators specific to fragile cities” to quantitatively measure disaster displaced persons’ (DDPs) vulnerabilities and current status of “income and social equality, microeconomic security, provision of basic services and social protection” while providing qualitative evidence on “social cohesion, social networks/social support and local government–community cooperation” (Patel and Nosal, 2016). © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Expansion of social network and the publication of its data have directed the risk of disclosure of individuals’ confidential information. Privacy preservation is a must thing before service providers publish the network data. In recent years, privacy in social network data has become the most concerned issue as it has gripped our lives in a dramatic manner. Numerous anonymization methods are there that assists in privacy preservation of social networking and among all, k-anonymity is the utmost one that helps in providing the security by developing graph and nodes degree. In this manuscript, the enhancement of K-anonymity has been addressed with major changes in node editing methodology. The clusters are developed with the integration of the same degree in one group and the procedure is iterated till the identification of noisy data. An advanced Cuckoo Search is commenced for minimizing the node miss placement in groups. The results of the Cuckoo Search are integrated with Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Networks to cross-check the structure and to reduce the node miss placement in groups. Average Path Length (APL) and Information parameters are measured for the evaluation and comparative analysis and the effectiveness of the research has been checked by comparing the results of Aanchal Sharma and P. R. Bhaladhare. There is a diminution of 14.6% while comparing APL with Aanchal Sharma and 8.61% and 10.38% of reduction is shown with Aanchal Sharma and P. R.

abstract={Rapid progress in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) during the last few decades has resulted in the emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), in which smart vehicles communicate with each other for information sharing. The exponential increase in the number of vehicles, together with an increasing data demands from in-vehicle users, has led to a tremendous growth of upstream data in the IoV infrastructure. However, the highly dynamic topology and distributed nature of vehicular networks exposes the vehicular traffic to higher security risks. To address these challenges, in this paper, "Sec-IoV", a multi-stage model for anomaly detection is specifically proposed for securing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in IoV setups. The proposed anomaly detection model comprises of multiple stages: (a) relevant feature set selection, (b) optimization of Support Vector Machine (SVM) parameters, and (c) classification of vehicular traffic into benign and anomalous. The first two stages are expressed using the multi-objective optimization problems, which are iteratively computed using the hybridization of a meta-heuristic approach "Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Optimization" with a Cauchy based mutation operator. This coupling is referred to as "C-ABC". It improves the local search capability of the optimizer with faster convergence. The last stage of data classification is then performed by employing SVM with a refined set of parameters. For the extensive evaluation of the proposed model, different state-of-the-art models have been executed on OMNET++ and SUMO. The obtained results in terms of the detection rate, accuracy, and false positive rate reflect the effectiveness of the proposed Sec-IoV model against the existing state-of-the-art schemes. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={Cloud computing is integrated lots of computing resources which are provided to users over the Internet on a Pay-As-You-Go mode. While multi-tenants and resources sharing are its advantages under the cloud computing environment, it also brings new risks in information security. One of the more difficult consequences of an attack is a flooding attack. This attack is to exhaust the network bandwidth and the computing resources of the server, causing the server to fail to provide services due to heavy workload and may affect the normal service. Other servers in the same infrastructure cause unpredictable losses. Based on the existing DDoS detection technology, this paper proposes a prevention mechanism based on feature selection and random forest classification models to detect hybrid flooding attacks, called HFADS. The HFADS scheme is mainly divided into three modules: (1) Resource Monitor Module (2) Data Features Selection Module (3) Machine Learning Evaluation Module. Based on the above three modules, we perform some simulations for HFADS to be compared with Mouhammd Alkasassbeh et al.’s method to detect flooding attacks of DDoS in terms of three KPIs including recall rate, accuracy rate and average processing time. The final experimental results indicate that HFADS can achieve 99.99% for UDP, 99.95% for ICMP and 99.99% for HTTP in recall rate, 99.98% in accuracy rate and 65.34 seconds in average processing time. Consequently, the proposed HFADS is more effective and efficient than Mouhammd Alkasassbeh et al.’s method for the identification of hybrid flooding attacks. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid development and broad applications of next-generation sequencing platforms and bioinformatic analytical tools, genomics has become a popular area for biosurveillance and international scientific collaboration. Governments from countries including the United States (US), Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom have leveraged these advancements to support international cooperative programs that aim to reduce biological threats and build scientific capacity worldwide. A recent conference panel addressed the impacts of the enhancement of genomic sequencing capabilities through three major US bioengagement programs on international scientific engagement and biosecurity risk reduction. The panel contrasted the risks and benefits of supporting the enhancement of genomic sequencing capabilities through international scientific engagement to achieve biological threat reduction and global health security. The lower costs and new bioinformatic tools available have led to the greater application of sequencing to biosurveillance. Strengthening sequencing capabilities globally for the diagnosis and detection of infectious diseases through mutual collaborations has a high return on investment for increasing global health security. International collaborations based on genomics and shared sequence data can build and leverage scientific networks and improve the timeliness and accuracy of disease surveillance reporting needed to identify and mitigate infectious disease outbreaks and comply with international norms. Further efforts to promote scientific transparency within international collaboration will improve trust, reduce threats, and promote global health security. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={In order to counteract today's sophisticated and increasing number of cyber threats the timely acquisition of information regarding vulnerabilities, attacks, threats, countermeasures and risks is crucial. Therefore, employees tasked with information security risk management processes rely on a variety of information security data sources, ranging from inter-organizational threat intelligence sharing platforms to public information security data sources, such as mailing lists or expert blogs. However, research and practice lack a comprehensive overview about these public information security data sources, their characteristics and dependencies. Moreover, comprehensive knowledge about these sources would be beneficial to systematically use and integrate them to information security processes. In this paper, a triangulation study is conducted to identify and analyze public information security data sources. Furthermore, a taxonomy is introduced to classify and compare these data sources based on the following six dimensions: (1) Type of information, (2) Integrability, (3) Timeliness, (4) Originality, (5) Type of Source,and (6) Trustworthiness. In total, 68 public information security data sources were identified and classified. The investigations showed that research and practice rely on a large variety of heterogeneous information security data sources, which makes it more difficult to integrate and use them for information security and risk management processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The use of medical devices in healthcare networks is increasing as governments and private entities look to improve clinical outcomes while reducing overall costs associate with healthcare service delivery. These devices which used to be stand-alone, are now becoming more integrated with corporate and clinical networks, sharing data between devices and other data information systems. As a result, healthcare networks are being targeted by hackers and malicious users and there is increasing concern about the possible risks that medical devices pose to both the security of patient data and the physical safety of patients. Therefore, a Medical Device Vulnerability Mitigation Effort Gap Analysis Taxonomy (MDV-MEGA) toolset is proposed to better understand what effort has been made by different associated parties to tackle the medical device vulnerability problem, and ultimately, help the associated parties determine which areas need further attention. This paper reviews literature over the last five years aiming to identify the amount of effort that has been contributed by five medical device associated parties: Authority, Device Manufacturers, Healthcare Facilities, Standards Organisations and Academia. First, a general background is presented to highlight existing issues, then the research and effort trends are discussed along with a presentation of the collated data. Additionally, each effort item is presented in the Medical Device Vulnerability Mitigation Effort Gap Analysis (MDV-MEGA) Taxonomy. Finally, the overall picture is summarised and, based on the results, recommendations to tackle the identified effort gaps, and future areas of research are proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Aircraft cyber security considerations do not include threats emanating from interactions with air traffic systems and those of cyber-physical nature. Next-generation air traffic systems escalate this security problem by adding new functions, such as making avionics rely on vulnerable information shared by surrounding vehicles. Hence, this paper focuses on the security threats to aircraft operating in air traffic systems, investigating risks and mitigations for these threats. This is a challenging because of the absence of foundations and in-depth understanding of aviation cyber security. Some major gaps include the lack of intelligence on implications of malicious air traffic data, avionics cyber security advances, and trustworthy airborne communications. This paper contributes a cyber-physical system security risk assessment framework that accounts for the impact of compromised air traffic control data on flights. In addition, we propose avionics-based foundations to detect compromised air traffic data using aircraft physics and onboard data and to protect flight position data confidentiality, leveraging flight patterns, airspace restrictions, and an information hiding technique, that stops advanced threats. The enabled solutions leverage aviation standards and are software updates, in contrast to state-of-the-art that typically warrants expensive and often an impractical mix of new avionics hardware, cryptographic key management, and major standard updates. Aviation cyber security research directions, including intelligence-based flight security, surveillance network security, system-wide security impact assessment, and security failure incident response and recovery mechanisms, are highlighted. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

abstract={With the wide adoption of the Internet, digital transactions surge exponentially and so do the impersonation fraud. While machine learning techniques show strong promise to be the building block for digital fraud detection systems, clients may be reluctant to share the raw data with such systems due to privacy concerns. The emerging privacy preserving machine learning techniques that employ homomorphic encryption to resolve this conundrum unfortunately increases the computational overhead of detection. In this paper, we present a first-of-a-kind empirical performance study of a private fraud detection system developed at SiS ID, a French business security platform. A privacy-preserving decision tree which can classify transactions into four risk classes (safe, moderately risky, very risky and fraud) is trained on more than 160000 real world transactions, and we quantitatively compare the classification accuracy, latency and network bandwidth under various combinations of encryption parameters and learning hyper-parameters, in order to explore the impact of the configuration on the performances. Our results show that the computation and communication overhead of processing encrypted data increases by an order of magnitude of 5, and highly depends on the configuration of the encryption key and the number of nodes in the decision tree. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={In this article, an extensive survey on optimal utilization of preemptible instances in cloud is presented. Different techniques used in state-of-the-art research for efficient utilization of spot instances have been classified and categorized in the paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of its kind. With the continuing growths in cloud computing, researchers and business personnels are exploiting the services provided by the cloud computing to reduce their operational cost. Users can share resources in the cloud with the help of virtualization. Virtualization provides abstraction of cloud to the users by hiding the complexity of inherent software and hardware present in the cloud. It increases the likelihood of running multiple operating systems (OSs) on a single physical machine with sharing of hardware resources. Each OS can be considered as a virtual machine (VM) installed on a physical machine. Based on subscription model, VMs can be classified into three types: reserved VMs, on-demand VMs and spot VMs. Spot instances are also known as preemptible VM instances. Spot instances are used as reduced cost resources at the risk of reliability. To utilize spot instances, users have to bid for them. Users will able to get the spot instances only if the biding price is greater than the spot instance price. As soon as the bid price becomes less than the spot price, the cloud provider will revoke the VMs (SIs). This survey aims to find the ways, one can efficiently utilize spot instances for executing the tasks with optimized cost and time. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Traditional risk management produces a rather static listing of weaknesses, probabilities and mitigations. Large share of cyber security risks realize through computer networks. These attacks or attack attempts produce events that are detected by various monitoring techniques such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Often the link between detecting these potentially dangerous real-time events and risk management process is lacking, or completely missing. This paper presents means for transferring and visualizing the network events in the risk management instantly with a tool called Metrics Visualization System (MVS). The tool is used to dynamically visualize network security events of a Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) network running in Software Defined Networking (SDN) context as a case study. Visualizations are presented with a treelike graph, that gives a quick easily understandable overview of the cyber security situation. This paper also discusses what network security events are monitored and how they affect the more general risk levels. The major benefit of this approach is that the risk analyst is able to map the designed risk tree/security metrics into actual real-time events and view the system's security posture with the help of a runtime visualization view. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has become an area of critical strategic interest. It is also a region that contains a range of serious and evolving non-traditional security problems, including the problem of maritime terrorism. As a result, many IOR states have called for stronger pan-regional intelligence collaboration to assist in risk mitigation against such violent and destabilizing threats. This article explores the challenges involved in establishing an effective intelligence exchange network in a region characterized by mistrust, diversity and a lack of established security priorities and protocols. Building upon the success of the IOR’s joint counter-piracy operations, it will argue that a less burdensome network-based approach is needed that can concentrate on issue-specific competencies and commonalties among states. In particular, while not without limitations, a more loosely coordinated and informal network governance approach can enhance opportunities to improve information-sharing to address common maritime security challenges, such as maritime terrorism, among IOR and extra-regional states. © 2018, © 2018 Indian Ocean Research Group.},

abstract={Lifeline infrastructure systems have always been crucial to the social, economic, and military security of societies. Because lifeline systems are critical to societal coherence and economic operations, assessing and mitigating risks to lifeline system operations is crucial. However, attention has shifted from risk assessment to resilience assessment due to the exceptionally large adaptation and mitigation needs implied by the geographic and temporal scope of natural and man-made hazards. The goal of this commentary is to introduce the concept of protocol-driven resilience. Protocol-driven resilience refers to the way in which the network of human relationships, operating protocols, evolving objectives, and information sharing processes produces resilient system behavior. Protocols are the formal and informal rules, and formal and informal processes that govern the nature, quality, and quantity of connectivity and interaction between the coupled system's physical and human components. Protocols are crucial to resilience of coupled infrastructure and natural systems because although the physical components of the infrastructure are relatively static, the protocols are dynamic and decomposable. We assert that the resilience of a system should be assessed by studying the range or diversity of conditions under which a protocol set preserves relationships.

abstract={To facilitate monitoring and management, modern Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are often equipped with wireless capabilities, which raise the risk of malicious access to IMDs. Although schemes are proposed to secure the IMD access, some issues are still open. First, pre-sharing a long-term key between a patient's IMD and a doctor's programmer is vulnerable since once the doctor's programmer is compromised, all of her patients suffer; establishing a temporary key by leveraging proximity gets rid of pre-shared keys, but as the approach lacks real authentication, it can be exploited by nearby adversaries or through man-in-the-middle attacks. Second, while prolonging the lifetime of IMDs is one of the most important design goals, few schemes explore to lower the communication and computation overhead all at once. Finally, how to safely record the commands issued by doctors for the purpose of forensics, which can be the last measure to protect the patients' rights, is commonly omitted in the existing literature. Motivated by these important yet open problems, we propose an innovative scheme e-SAFE, which significantly improves security and safety, reduces the communication overhead and enables IMD-access forensics. We present a novel lightweight compressive sensing based encryption algorithm to encrypt and compress the IMD data simultaneously, reducing the data transmission overhead by over 50% while ensuring high data confidentiality and usability. Furthermore, we provide a suite of protocols regarding device pairing, dual-factor authentication, and accountability-enabled access. The security analysis and performance evaluation show the validity and efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The introduction of Internet of Things has attracted increasing number of security risks to the smart home due to the continual exposure of devices to remote network. As a last line of defence, security guidelines are issued to the user to supplement network and manufacturer level risk mitigation efforts. While these guidelines address specific security issues, they are varied and lacking in structure for common representation, understanding and sharing among the smart home community (vendors, developers and household). The smart home user as the executor of these guidelines is faced with additional responsibility that can make the smart home management a daunting task. In this work, an ontology is proposed to represent knowledge about the security guidelines for interoperability and understanding among the smart home actors. Further to this, a context-based ontology is developed, which adapts to changing contextual information like user context and physical context. We highlight different use cases of security guidelines and discuss how the context-based ontology can help the user perform these guidelines automatically. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Most organizations including armed forces continuously invested on security solutions such as security information and event management, next generation firewall and intrusion prevention systems to improve their cybersecurity capabilities. Even though most legacy monitoring tools can detect cyber threats, the warfighting and business information systems remain vulnerable to modified or unknown threats since those are evolved continuously in a covert manner. At the Seoul Defense Dialogue (SDD) Cyber Working Group (CWG) 2017, we discussed several agendas related to the civil-military cooperative effort those can improve cybersecurity capabilities with high-risk/high-payoff research in the digital transformation era. The essence is granting the cyber workforces access to appropriate data from various sources needed to assure mission completeness based on the current technological achievement. In various situations, military operations must be synchronized with kinetic forces by appropriate cyber information. For this purpose, the cyber situational awareness (SA) provides the risk mitigation and the resilience capability for the mission completeness. To improve SA capabilities, it is important to share data with big data and machine learning technology among civil-military and international cooperation especially for defensive cyber operations. In this paper we described the lessons learned from SDD CWG to improve the state of the cybersecurity and the cognitive technology for the improved cyber situational awareness. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={Recently with the emergence of Software Defined Networking (SDN), cloud environments have gone through modifications as traditional data centers adopt SDN as a network management solution. As cloud networking platform provides great power to configure networks in cloud, there is also a downside that intruders and hackers may control the network functionality which may lead to more damage than in legacy networks. Even though cloud networking providers implement the most of the security standards, data storage and important files on external service providers may lead to risk. The ease in procuring and accessing cloud services can also give users the ability to scan, identify and exploit loopholes and vulnerabilities within a system. For instance, in a multi-tenant cloud architecture where multiple users are hosted on the same server, a hacker might try to break into the data of other users hosted and stored on the same server. However, such exploits and loopholes are not likely to surface and the likelihood of a compromise is not great. Understanding traffic flows will extract issues out and methods can be suggested dealing with it. Security concerns here are highly expanded attack that includes the control and data plane. Security challenges are unique to clouds that differ from SDN. In this paper, SDN cloud applications are compared and analysis of three applications such as Meridian, CloudNaaS and HPE Virtual Cloud Network are performed. Main factor for choosing the three applications are their market share and wide deployment. The architecture of these applications are explained and security analysis is done using a threat analysis tool called STRIDE. We suggest some mitigation techniques for the well known threats like spoofing, tampering of data, repudiation and also check if the application has in-built countermeasures against these threats. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a key climate mitigation technology required to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming. Commercial-scale demonstration projects such as the Quest project in Alberta, Canada, or the Illinois Basin-Decatur project in Illinois, USA, have shown that the technology is feasible and safe. These projects demonstrate that existing technologies are sufficient for the successful implementation of CCS at the mega-tonne/year scale. However, scaling these technologies to meet the future need for giga-tonne/year storage remains a shared industry challenge. Responding to it demands addressing the low-probability, high-impact storage risks that cannot always be avoided within a large and diverse portfolio of CO2 storage projects. These include the risk of induced seismicity and fault reactivation, pressure management to improve storage security, exposure to legacy wells, and lowering the cost of large-scale containment monitoring. We propose four technology development pathways to address these giga-ton/year challenges, highlighting key focus areas. © 2018 European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers, EAGE.

abstract={The resilience concept and its application in the context of urban security encounter a series of grounded challenges for scientists, policy-makers, planning bodies, and the manifold authorities of jurisdiction and civil services. This chapter outlines a joint effort to explore structural and functional similarities and differences in France and Germany with regard to crisis management in urban systems, with the ultimate goal of identifying potential pathways of applying the resilience concept and exploring the potential for cross-national collaborative actions. Specific aspects of urban resilience and crisis management are portrayed: cross-border and international aspects, community resilience, psychosocial crisis management, and knowledge and information. In both countries, past and ongoing activities demonstrate the potential of connecting scientists and decision-makers in policy and practice to integrate multiple perspectives, bridging existing barriers between research, policy, and operational practice, and stimulating new technologies and innovative solutions. Furthermore, it became clear that enhancing urban resilience requires governance structures that promote cooperation among and between science, policy, and practice. Likewise, crisis management practices can be enriched through bi-national partnerships, collective activities, and shared co-management efforts. It is therefore suggested to further examine the various network strategies within hierarchical and horizontal collaboration structures and address the question of how the structural arrangements for collaboration within crisis management networks influence disaster resilience in urban areas. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={The NASA Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program is responsible for providing communication and navigation services to scientific and human space exploration missions. SCaN's current Space Network provides radio frequency (RF) relay services to near Earth space missions via Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS). SCaN plans to offer a new generation of relay services beginning in 2025, including the addition of optical communications capabilities and enhanced RF capabilities. The primary drivers behind the development of these next generation relay network services are to enhance communication and navigation services with significantly reduced development and operational costs. Several approaches being considered for implementation of these services are through government owned capabilities, through commercial service providers, or a combination of the two. One approach receiving a great deal of attention is the use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) to develop and provide capabilities or services. Utilizing Public-Private Partnerships allows NASA and commercial entities to share the investment, standards, and risks of developing and testing new or enhanced capabilities which can benefit both NASA and the commercial space communication industry. The capabilities developed under the PPP can then be used to support the growth of the commercial satellite communications industry while simultaneously being introduced into NASA operations to provide service to future NASA missions as part of the NASA Next Space Communication Generation Architecture. Partnerships formed for this purpose can also serve as the basis for further NASA acquisition activities where government and industry can continue to share the cost, risk, and benefits of space communications capability development and operations. This objective is consistent with the 2010 National Space Policy stated principles: "The United States is committed to encouraging and facilitating the growth of a U.S. commercial space sector that supports U.S. needs, is globally competitive, and advances U.S. leadership in the generation of new markets and innovation-driven entrepreneurship". [1] NASA has conducted several internal studies as well as externally funded studies with industry to define the next generation space communication architecture. NASA has approached the commercial industry through a Request for Information (RFI) to define further the next generation architecture. The results are promising and are shaping the approach to utilize Public Private Partnership to achieve NASA's objectives while reducing costs. The commercial satellite industry has begun to deploy high performance, high throughput global satellite constellations which have the potential to provide communication services to NASA Missions. Commercial satellite manufacturers have advanced their processes to rapidly design, build, and deliver, reliable communication satellites using minimum government oversight. This paper presents how PPPs can contribute to NASA's Next Generation Space Communication Architecture. It provides a brief description of the Next Generation Architecture along with the role of PPPs recently presented at NASA's RFI industry day. Finally, it also describes a brief status of the PPP assessment and the path forward. © 2018 FGM Events LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Growing complexity in modern software is making signature-based intrusion detection an increasing challenge. Many recent intrusion detection systems rely on accurate recovery of application semantics from memory. In this paper, we approach the problem from a different angle. We observe that the user applications in corporate network often run in identical system environments due to standardized IT deployment procedure. The same applications share similar runtime statistics across different workstations through out the time, despite different uses by the end users. When an application is compromised on one workstation, its runtime profile would be different from the rest, similar to how a black penguin would look distinctly different from the rest of the colony. In this work, we present our preliminary study on Black Penguin, a compare-view based intrusion detection system leveraging homogeneity of application-level memory statistics in corporate environment. The detection system follows a three-step process that includes memory analysis, unsupervised learning and risk mitigation. To explore the feasibility of Black Penguin, we conduct two types of experiments using Internet Explorer and Firefox as target applications. First, we examine the statistical differences of the same application under different user usage. To this end, we collect and analyze memory statistics of browser when visiting the top 500 websites ranked by Moz. Second, we examine the difference when the application is under attack. Several browser attacks are used to generate the intrusion samples. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. Lastly, we also provide discussions on the limitations of the proposed system as well as future directions. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This tutorial provides a thorough review of the main research directions in the field of identity management and identity related security threats in Online Social Networks (OSNs). The continuous increase in the numbers and sophistication levels of fake accounts constitutes a big threat to the privacy and to the security of honest OSN users. Uninformed OSN users could be easily fooled into accepting friendship links with fake accounts, giving them by that access to personal information they intend to exclusively share with their real friends. Moreover, these fake accounts subvert the security of the system by spreading malware, connecting with honest users for nefarious goals such as sexual harassment or child abuse, and make the social computing environment mostly untrustworthy. The tutorial introduces the main available research results available in this area, and presents our work on collaborative identity validation techniques to estimate OSN profiles trustworthiness. © 2017 author(s).},

abstract={Data mining and information extraction from data is a field that has gained relevance in recent years thanks to techniques based on artificial intelligence and use of machine and deep learning. The main aim of the present work is the development of a tool based on a previous behaviour study of security audit tools (oriented to SQL pentesting) with the purpose of creating testing sets capable of performing an accurate detection of a SQL attack. The study is based on the information collected through the generated web server logs in a pentesting laboratory environment. Then, making use of the common extracted patterns from the logs, each attack vector has been classified in risk levels (dangerous attack, normal attack, non-attack, etc.). Finally, a training with the generated data was performed in order to obtain a classifier system that has a variable performance between 97 and 99 percent in positive attack detection. The training data is shared to other servers in order to create a distributed network capable of deciding if a query is an attack or is a real petition and inform to connected clients in order to block the petitions from the attacker's IP. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={With the onset of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, the number of IoT devices and sensors is increasing tremendously. This paper is concerned with a health IoT system consisting of various IoT devices carried by members of an environmental health community. We propose a novel trust-based decision making protocol that uses trust-based information sharing among the health IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and time. This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or intentionally. We present performance data of our trust-based health IoT protocol and conduct a comparative performance analysis of our protocol with two baseline protocols to demonstrate the feasibility. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is taking the technology world by storm because of the varieties of services offered by the cloud service providers (CSPs). Despite numerous benefits offered by CSPs, there are some security issues that may dissuade users from using it. In this service, different virtual machines (VMs) share the same physical resources, these VMs are known as co-resident VMs. The shared physical resources pose a significant threat to the users. As resources may belong to competing organizations as well as unknown attackers. From the perspective of a cloud user, there is no guarantee whether the co-resident VMs are trustworthy. The shared resources make privacy and perfect isolation implausible, which paves the way for co-resident attacks, where a VM attacks another co-resident VM. There is a risk that a covert side channel can be used to extract another user's secret information or launch denial of service attacks. In this paper, we analyze the co-resident attacks and corresponding defense strategies, with respect to benign and malicious VMs and the VM Monitor (VMM), using a signaling game model, named Co-resident Attacks Mitigation and Prevention. The solution to the game provides optimal defense strategies for the VMM. We evaluate the game results by conducting simulation and find that the defender can fail co-resident attacks effectively by distinguishing the benign and malicious VMs efficiently. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={To provide a comprehensive security analysis of modern networked systems, we need to take into account the combined effects of existing vulnerabilities and zero-day vulnerabilities. In addition to them, it is important to incorporate new vulnerabilities emerging from threats such as BYOD, USB file sharing. Consequently, there may be new dependencies between system components that could also create new attack paths, but previous work did not take into account those new attack paths in their security analysis (i.e., not all attack paths are taken into account). Thus, countermeasures may not be effective, especially against attacks exploiting the new attack paths. In this paper, we propose a Unified Vulnerability Risk Analysis Module (UV-RAM) to address the aforementioned problems by taking into account the combined effects of those vulnerabilities and capturing the new attack paths. The three main functionalities of UV-RAM are: (i) to discover new dependencies and new attack paths, (ii) to incorporate new vulnerabilities introduced and zero-day vulnerabilities into security analysis, and (iii) to formulate mitigation strategies for hardening the networked system. Our experimental results demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of UV-RAM. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) process involves several activities to conduct a risk management (RM) task in an organization. ISRM activities require access to various information related to the organization. An organization often needs to share information related to an ISRM process with the stakeholders involved in the activity. Therefore, it is important to manage the information which is critical to the operations of the organization. The presence of an information classification scheme can enable the proper handling of the information involved in the RM task. We selected ISO/IEC27005:2011 risk management standard to assess various information generated during the process of applying this standard in an organization. The purpose of this study is to propose a framework to show various information objects involved in ISO27005 risk management standard and classify the information based on the guideline provided by UNINETT scheme. A case scenario of a health clinic is developed to identify ISRM related information objects using the proposed framework and classify the information using UNINETT scheme. © 2017 IEEE.},

First, ACCUSE assigns to each app risk factors based on the Android classification of permissions. Then, such factors are combined with the app rating and downloading information to produce a new, overall risk factor. ACCUSE has been evaluated on a realworld dataset of 11,576 android apps as well as on a baseline of around 1000 known malware apps. Our results show that ACCUSE always assigns high risk to known malware apps, and outperforms the state-of-the-art. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud enables computing as a utility by offering convenient, on-demand network access to a centralized pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly deployed with great efficiency and minimal management overhead. In order to realize the benefits of the innovative cloud computing paradigm, companies must overcome heightened risks and security threats associated with it. Security and privacy in cloud is complex owing to newer dimensions in problem scope such as multi-tenant architectures and shared infrastructure, elasticity, measured services, viability etc. In this paper, we survey existing literature on cloud security issues and risks which then guides us to provide a section on auditing based to address the identified risks. We also provide a discourse on risk assessment frameworks to highlight benefits using such structured methods for understanding risks. The main contribution of the paper is investigation of current innovations in cloud computing that are targeted towards assisting in effective management of aforementioned risks and security issues. The compilation of discussed solutions has been developed to cater to specific cloud security, compliance and privacy requirements across industries by cloud service providers, software-as-a-service (SaaS) application vendors and advisory firms. © 2018 by IGI Global.

abstract={Covert channels have been known for a long time because of their versatile forms of appearance. For nearly every technical improvement or change in technology, such channels have been (re-)created or known methods have been adapted. For example, the introduction of hyperthreading technology has introduced new possibilities for covert communication between malicious processes because they can now share the arithmetic logical unit as well as the L1 and L2 caches, which enable establishing multiple covert channels. Even virtualization, which is known for its isolation of multiple machines, is prone to covert- and side-channel attacks because of the sharing of resources. Therefore, it is not surprising that cloud computing is not immune to this kind of attacks. Moreover, cloud computing with multiple, possibly competing users or customers using the same shared resources may elevate the risk of illegitimate communication. In such a setting, the “air gap” between physical servers and networks disappears, and only the means of isolation and virtual separation serve as a barrier between adversary and victim. In the work at hand, we will provide a survey on vulnerable spots that an adversary could exploit trying to exfiltrate private data from target virtual machines through covert channels in a cloud environment. We will evaluate the feasibility of example attacks and point out proposed mitigation solutions in case they exist. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This study utilizes genealogically linked longitudinal data to examine how extended family networks insure against financial risks from severely limiting health conditions. We find that nonhealth consumption of unmarried households declines in response to worsening health, whereas married households smooth expenditures in a way that is consistent with full insurance. Families mitigate losses by reallocating home production, drawing down home equity, holding formal health insurance, collecting social security, and receiving transfers from noncoresident relatives. We illustrate that the costs of health shocks are transmitted throughout family networks, and that noncoresident children draw down their assets and consumption when responding to a parent's health decline. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Although providing economic prospects for companies and contractors, the sharing economy presents a variety of challenges for all parties, including the proper classification of the employment relationship; the use of, and access to, private property; and data privacy and security.

abstract={Network security is a challenging task, as there is a tremendous growth of network - based services and sharing of sensitive information on the network. Intrusion throws a serious risk in the network. Even though many hardening systems are developed against intrusions, conventional approaches like firewalls, virtual private networks, and encryption techniques are not enough to provide network security. Intrusion detection is a cyber security mechanism that plays an important role in securing the network. Detection rate and false alarm rate are the challenging issues to design an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Various data mining techniques are used to implement network intrusion detection. Classification is a supervised learning which predicts the class label in the data set. Single classifier fails to obtain high accuracy. Base classifiers are not capable of detecting the attacks accurately. Ensemble classifier is a combination of base classifiers. Ensemble classifier outperforms base classifiers. In this paper, we propose a cluster - based ensemble classifier for IDS. K means clustering is used in the experiment. Ensemble classifier is built using ADTree and KNN. The experimental results show that the proposed ensemble classifier outperforms other classifiers with 99.8% accuracy. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Social media and networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, Google Apps, and many other Internet-based capabilities such as video sharing, weblogs, message boards, etc., offer a unique forum for discussion and collaboration across the Department of Defense (DOD) community and with the general public. However, this medium comes with risks and vulnerabilities–both technical and behavioral. SNSs are a proven haven for adversarial actors and content, and provide them with a lucrative attack vector into the DOD information networks. DOD policy, however, states that commanders must allow DOD personnel access to SNSs. Thus, commanders at all levels must balance appropriate Internet security measures while allowing access to Internet-based capabilities such as SNSs. This article examines both the technical and behavioral threats associated with SNS, the current DOD and Air Force policies on social media, and offers recommendations to minimize threats and maximize security, including a renewed emphasis on operational security and information security awareness training with a focus on social media. © 2017, U.S. Air Force, Air University.

abstract={European Union Member States are working towards an integrated maritime surveillance and deeper information sharing and implementation of Common Information Sharing Environment. Value networks aiming at co-creation, need active facilitation, and relevant platforms for open cooperation. This study analysed scenario analytics, and narrative documents from projects CoopP, CISE, and MARISA by using a Data Extraction Table to classify both objects and phenomenon relevant to European maritime information sharing systems. The object and phenomenon rows are grouped under a European Coast Guard Functions, CGFs framework, to better understand their occurrence and interdependencies. This paper finds that objects and phenomena need to be continuously evaluated against evolving risk and treat scenarios and end-user needs. Shared maritime information systems need to include tools for continuous self-revaluation. Added complexity may greatly reduce the time to value creation and innovation, which in this context is the ability to create greater common knowledge, learning, and value. Thus, faster and more widely shared information on objects and phenomena result in an accurate Recognized Maritime Picture, which supports threat assessment, asset and operations planning, and sharing of resources for added safety and security on the European maritime domain. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={Virtual Organization (VO) represents a prominent collaboration initiative, where a set of entities share competencies and risks attending a common goal. Moreover, their interactions can be supported in an Internet basis, using Cloud Computing (CC) resources. The VO and CC integration brings several benefits, such as: Reduction of costs and maintenance, interoperability, among others. However, there are issues related to privacy, trust and security that need to be addressed. One of the issues observed is how much trust VO members put in the cloud provider (CP), particularly, in a scenario where VO members use the resources provided by a CP to made available their services and in order to interact with other members. Thus, the proposed reputation architecture intends to assist the decision-making processes present in the VO's life-cycle reputing CP trust. The reputed trust is based on two sources: A) objective (Quality of Service (QoS) indicators) and b) subjective (feedback from users regarding those QoS indicators). The evaluation results show that the architecture is resilient to attacks on subjective trust during the reputation calculation. Also, it is possible to note that the proposed architecture presents an acceptable average time for each one operation, and a significant role during VO's creation and operation. ©2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={As a consequence of government objectives in terms of CO2 reduction and with the aim of increasing the share of renewable energy sources within the power system of Europe, offshore sites for wind power gain more and more importance. Within the last years the installed capacity of offshore wind reached 3 GW in the German Bight of the North Sea, most of them being connected through high voltage direct current (hvdc) transmission systems. Since the capacity of installed offshore transmission systems is increasing, redundancy is of great interest to guarantee system security in case of contingencies. This contribution investigates the possibility of offshore ac interconnections to reduce the risk of wind power being curtailed due to network outages and evaluates the economic feasibility of such grid expansion projects. The interconnection of BorWin gamma and DolWin beta is chosen as study case. For this purpose, reliability analyses are performed together with load flow studies based on wind power time series. In addition, economic considerations are carried out by means of investment evaluation. Reliability analyses are performed utilizing analytical Markov method in order to clearly distinguish system states in the latter process. The results show that ac interconnection can be beneficial for distances less than 40 km between converter stations assuming moderate reliability of offshore components. Furthermore, strong sensitivities are pointed out between the economic benefit and the reliability. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The amount of coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong and independent predictor of cardiovascular events. CAC is clinically quantified in cardiac calcium scoring CT (CSCT), but it has been shown that cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) may also be used for this purpose. We present a method for automatic CAC quantification in CCTA. This method uses supervised learning to directly identify and quantify CAC without a need for coronary artery extraction commonly used in existing methods. The study included cardiac CT exams of 250 patients for whom both a CCTA and a CSCT scan were available. To restrict the volume-of-interest for analysis, a bounding box around the heart is automatically determined. The bounding box detection algorithm employs a combination of three ConvNets, where each detects the heart in a different orthogonal plane (axial, sagittal, coronal). These ConvNets were trained using 50 cardiac CT exams. In the remaining 200 exams, a reference standard for CAC was defined in CSCT and CCTA. Out of these, 100 CCTA scans were used for training, and the remaining 100 for evaluation of a voxel classification method for CAC identification. The method uses ConvPairs, pairs of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The first ConvNet in a pair identifies voxels likely to be CAC, thereby discarding the majority of non-CAC-like voxels such as lung and fatty tissue. The identified CAC-like voxels are further classified by the second ConvNet in the pair, which distinguishes between CAC and CAC-like negatives. Given the different task of each ConvNet, they share their architecture, but not their weights. Input patches are either 2.5D or 3D. The ConvNets are purely convolutional, i.e. no pooling layers are present and fully connected layers are implemented as convolutions, thereby allowing efficient voxel classification. The performance of individual 2.5D and 3D ConvPairs with input sizes of 15 and 25 voxels, as well as the performance of ensembles of these ConvPairs, were evaluated by a comparison with reference annotations in CCTA and CSCT. In all cases, ensembles of ConvPairs outperformed their individual members. The best performing individual ConvPair detected 72% of lesions in the test set, with on average 0.85 false positive (FP) errors per scan. The best performing ensemble combined all ConvPairs and obtained a sensitivity of 71% at 0.48 FP errors per scan. For this ensemble, agreement with the reference mass score in CSCT was excellent (ICC 0.944 [0.918–0.962]). Aditionally, based on the Agatston score in CCTA, this ensemble assigned 83% of patients to the same cardiovascular risk category as reference CSCT. In conclusion, CAC can be accurately automatically identified and quantified in CCTA using the proposed pattern recognition method. This might obviate the need to acquire a dedicated CSCT scan for CAC scoring, which is regularly acquired prior to a CCTA, and thus reduce the CT radiation dose received by patients. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Online Social Network provides a simple and easier way to connect with our friends and relatives to share daily activities and event of our day to day life. Most of us cannot live without social network. But just like other online activity, even social networks are having lot of security threats to its users. Most of Research on Social Network reveals that Social Network are the primary sources for getting confidential information of the victim so that they can do numerous fraudulent activities like cyber bullying, money laundering, spreading fake or false messages to create panic situation in public or to fool other user. They already have set their target on social networking website to do their fraudulent activities. Fraudsters are always trying to find any loopholes in the existing system so that they can get access to the system to launch various social engineering attack and scam activities. The security and privacy on these networks has been increasing as the amount of personal information posted by millions of users in their profile is made public. A social networking site allows millions of users to communicate online and large amount of information has been posted daily. So in every few seconds a large amount of data has been generated around the world. This necessitates the adaptation of new methodology to provide security of online data. Social network users are not aware of the various security threats and the associated risks exist in these networks. This paper presents an assessment of classification different social network and different attacks present on those social networks and methodology has been proposed which help the online users to be safe from numerous fraudulent and malicious activities on the web. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Pakistan’s largest metropolis and economic hub, Karachi, surrounded by numerous tectonically active faults, is illequipped to cope with seismic hazards. The city is vulnerable mainly due to inadequate construction techniques, lack of awareness, political will and scant historical seismic data. The existing disaster management policies often remain ineffective or unimplemented due to technical or financial constraints, shortage of trained personnel and weak information-sharing mechanisms. This research identifies such challenges in Karachi and explores the global disaster risk reduction initiatives from better prepared countries, whose implementation feasibility is assessed based on local economic, social, topographical and political circumstances. Shortlisting five fundamental aspects of disaster risk reduction, a multi-prong strategy is devised, addressing Karachi’s vulnerability and exposure to both urban communities and slums. An earthquake early warning system model using cell broadcast technology is formulated, proposing to supplement the existing upgradable seismic network in Pakistan. This and other priority measures constituting the proposed strategy present a customised pragmatic approach of shifting from an emergency response paradigm towards prevention, mitigation and preparedness. © 2016, Thomas Telford Services Ltd.

abstract={Purpose – Information sharing enhances the supply chain profitability significantly, but it may result in adverse impacts also (e.g. leakages of secret information to competitors, sharing of wrong information that result into losses). So, it is important to understand the various risk factors that lead to distortion in information sharing and results in negative consequences. Information risk identification and assessment in supply chain would help in choosing right mitigation strategies. The purpose of this paper is to identify various information risks that could impact a supply chain, and develop a conceptual framework to quantify them. Design/methodology/approach – Bayesian belief network (BBN) modeling will be used to provide a framework for information risk analysis in a supply chain. Bayesian methodology provides the reasoning in causal relationship among various risk factors and incorporates both objective and subjective data. Findings – This paper presents a causal relationship among various information risks in a supply chain. Three important risk factors, namely, information security, information leakages and reluctance toward information sharing showed influence on a company’s revenue. Practical implications – Capability of Bayesian networks while modeling in uncertain conditions, provides a prefect platform for analyzing the risk factors. BBN provides a more robust method for studying the impact or predicting various risk factors. Originality/value – The major contribution of this paper is to develop a quantitative model for information risks in supply chain. This model can be updated when a new data arrives. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The traditional Visual Sharing Scheme is used for securely transmitting or delivering the secret images across the network. In this scheme the secret images is split into n shares and distributed among the participants. These shares can be either in the form of noise-like pixel or meaningful images, but it will provoke suspicion and enhance interception risk during transmission of the shares. To overcome this problem natural-image based VSS scheme (NVSS) was developed that shares the secret image over n-1 randomly selected natural shares and one noise-like share, but the generated noise-like share suffers from the problem where the texture of the secret images could be revealed on the share. Because of this complex data hiding scheme was used to hide the share but this required more time. In the proposed scheme technique is proposed which will totally eliminate the appearance of secret image texture and generated share is totally innocuous and does not reveal any information about the secret image. There was no need to hide the share using complex and time consuming data hiding. The proposed scheme is more efficient and requires less time and could hide the content of secret image. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Brazil has registered many natural and technical disasters. Significant human, material, social and environmental damages are found both in national proportion disaster events and in small and local ones. In this context, one of the important disaster scenarios are the construction works. The main goal of this contribution is to present, unprecedentedly, the consolidation of disaster data registered since 2009 at Belo Horizonte by the Civil Defense Municipal System (SIMDEC), used by the Municipal Civil Defense Office (COMDEC), a public agency of the City Hall and winner of the Sasakawa Awards 2013. The methodology used for data treatment follows the one created by the National Center of Risk and Disaster Management, published in the Natural Disaster Yearbook 2013, with adjustments to the local reality and focus on technical disasters. To reduce disaster risks in both national and local scales is one of the advices of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. The data pointed a large share of technical disasters and risks, civil engineering related ones responding for almost 90% of these occurrences. Results revealed that this kind of event occurs almost every day and can range from simple infiltrations or cracks to huge collapses, like the Batalha dos Guararapes viaduct crash, during the 2014 FIFA World Cup, with two deaths. Furthermore, disaster risk maps were drawn and showed that almost 20% of the disasters happens in suburban villages and slums, which accounts only for 5% of the municipal territory and 15% of the city population. They also revealed that occurrences are more frequent in middle-class areas, where construction works are often supervised by engineers, which indicates that risks are not being taken into account fully by them. Thus, engineer's role is identified as fundamental to disaster risk reduction. © 2016 CURRAN-CONFERENCE. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The vulnerability of Global Navigation Satellite Systems to spoofing attacks along with potential mitigation strategies has been the subject of discussion in many industry segments where the delivery of precise timing is of high importance. Whilst several high-profile examples of GPS position spoofing have been presented, the effect and impact of faked GNSS signals on timing systems is less well appreciated. The authors are aware of the effects on GNSS timing applications of natural and intentional disruption to signals. Recent events have shown the GNSS community that the replication of GNSS signals requires less expertise than was previously the case. Some of the myths around GNSS spoofing - including the difficulty of replicating GPS signals and the high cost of equipment- will be shown not to be significant barriers and the need to understand the response of GNSS receivers and systems in the commercial sector to this type of threat is therefore of greater significance. This paper documents the results of experiments during summer 2015 when several representative commercial timing receivers were tested on a GPS spoofing test-bed and subjected to some example attack vectors. It also highlights the fact that protection techniques against such attacks exist today and could be implemented in many systems. An introduction to the known vulnerabilities of GNSS is presented with an emphasis on the effects of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) spoofing and cyber-attacks relevant to users of timing systems. Real, published instances of commercial segment GPS spoofing and hacking are reviewed along with the authors' insights into the actual and expected evolution of relevant threat vectors and approaches to identify, flag and mitigate risk to timing systems. The set-up and operation of the spoofing test-bed used to conduct tests is explained and the results of the testing campaign are presented along with a detailed analysis of the behavior of the systems under test. It will be shown that when signal disruption is introduced, the effects on a timing receiver could be unpredictable and lead to unexpected system behavior. The need to test the response of GNSS timing receivers and systems in the presence of realistic threats will be shown to be an important step in risk reduction The authors discuss the relevance and implications of their results for timing systems in use today and share their thoughts and ideas on achieving improved levels of robustness in Timing systems that use GNSS. A selection of potential mitigation techniques that are applicable to timing systems will be presented - this will include the use of complementary Positioning, Navigation and Timing Systems such as e-LORAN, GNSS Receiver Integrity checks, receiver power level detection, position checking, and time comparison with alternate timing sources. Finally the authors will present their ideas for future work. The limitations of the experiments will be discussed and causes for some of the unpredictable behavior of the units under test will be advanced as well as proposed approaches for gaining a deeper understanding of some of the observed behavior of the timing receivers that were tested. © 2016 The Institute of Navigation, Inc.},

abstract={As is known to all, the Internet is open and shared. These two characteristics make the Internet has a wealth of resources. However, they bring security risks to the Internet. One solution is to establish a security system that is relatively easy to achieve, and to establish the appropriate security assistance system in accordance with a certain security policy. In terms of computer security in the network environment, we need a kind of technology that can detect and report the unauthorized or abnormal phenomena in the system, that is, the intrusion detection technology. Data mining is a data analysis and processing technology which is a kind of widely used. Data mining technology can quickly and effectively analyze the big data, and find out the useful information and knowledge. Clustering analysis is an important tool in data mining, and clustering analysis is used to find the potential relationship between the data attributes. The k-means algorithm is a typical clustering algorithm that has the advantages of fast convergence speed and strong local search ability. But k-means algorithm has some defects, such as the sensitivity to the initial centre, easy to fall into local optimum. In order to improve the detection effect of intrusion detection system, this paper researches on the commonly used clustering and classification techniques in data mining. Then, in order to solve the problem that the detection result is affected by the initial clustering centre and number setting, we propose a k-means clustering algorithm based on genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithm has good global optimization ability, and the improved crossover operator and mutation operator can be used to generate a better chromosome. Finally, through the simulation of KDD CUP99 data set, the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach is verified. The experimental results show that this method improves the accuracy of clustering, speeds up the convergence rate, and enhances the stability of the algorithm.

abstract={International cooperation between national road owners can aid structuring and implementing climate change adaptation strategies throughout the European network. Climate change adaptation on roads can be defined as the concrete measures implemented to reduce vulnerability to more extreme weather phenomena in the future in order to increase resilience and robustness for continuous road safety and mobility. As evident in multiple scientific papers and authorities, such as the IPCC, climate change adaptation is gaining more general interest and political focus since actions of mitigation to climate change no longer seem to singlehandedly provide sufficient effect to future sustainable transportation on roads. As with actions related to mitigating climate change, allocating resources to climate change adaptation and successfully anchoring this subject in an organization, e.g. a national road authority (NRA), can be a highly demanding task which oftentimes can be overwhelming in its nature. Implementation of climate change R&D projects, alone, is a topic where interdisciplinary approaches are of high request, regularly resulting in time-consuming processes with many potential pitfalls, politically and technically. Therefore, the CEDR I4 group on mitigation and adapting to climate change has decided to have the following three topics as a combined objective to generate an outcome which will act as a template for organizations, e.g. NRAs, to initiate, develop, and/or complete climate change adaptation measures:Strategy and action planAwarenessRisk methodology approach The strategy template will focus on managing, improving, preventing and cooperation, and will provide specific examples on areas to study. These include examples of information to road users, incident management, implementation through planning phases, tools for risk analyses, legislative work, research and information sharing and many others. Likewise, a template for an action plan is provided, giving examples on how to ensure responsibility and anchor climate change adaptation in the organization in order to actually direct the organization towards a more climate-resilient profile. The organizational awareness of climate change adaptation in an interdisciplinary context is considered undeniably crucial in this regard, since this will form the basis on how to act and prioritize resources. Examples of known methodologies of climate change adaptation will be highlighted to act as inspirational examples. As an example, such methodologies include risk mapping, e.g. the Blue Spot model or the Quick Scan approach. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={India is the world's fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Transport contributes 13 % of India's GHG emissions (MoEF. India: green house gas emissions 2007, Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment (INCCA), Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). Government of India, New Delhi. Accessed Sept 2013, 2010). Driven by rising population, income, and urbanization, under a business-as-usual scenario, India's energy demand from transport is projected to increase sixfold in 2050 from current levels. This has vital impact on key national sustainable development indicators like energy security and air pollution. In response, several national and subnational policies and measures were initiated to ameliorate the adverse impacts of transport decisions on sustainability. These include national policies and programs for fuel efficiency, low-carbon technologies, investments in public transport infrastructure, and climate change mitigation. These aside, several bottom-up interventions that are initiated locally are showing promise. This chapter offers an overview of transport sector in India and presents selected best practice case studies that identify good practices. Evidently, the challenge is to replicate and scale up these practices to gain sizable CO2 mitigation together with co-benefits vis-á-vis various national sustainable development goals. The assessments show that successful implementation of national policies at the subnational level requires widely agreed goals and targets and support from the national government. The support can be in the form of capacity building, technology, or finance. In the overall, the chapter argues for (1) integrating transport policies with local, national, and global objectives, (2) a comprehensive assessment of the impacts (co-benefits and risks) of policies and project from the planning to the post-implementation stage, and (3) cooperation and knowledge sharing among cities and regions facilitated by the national government for cross-learning and transfer of best practices. The lessons from these studies provide important learnings for designing policies and projects elsewhere including other developing countries. © The Author(s) 2016. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Despite a long history of volcanic debris flows on the northern flank of San Vicente Volcano, El Salvador, authorities and communities were ill-prepared for the lahars that occurred on Nov. 7-8, 2009. More than 250 people were killed by lahars resulting from shallow landslides, not to mention millions of dollars (US) in damage to houses, agriculture, and infrastructure. After the disaster, significant aid was invested in the region to reduce risk in future disasters. This case study uses the ethnographic tools of qualitative interviews, participant observation, and review of institutional documents to analyze two particular aspects of disaster risk reduction strategies in the town of Verapaz: 1) relocation of at-risk residents led by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, and 2) hazard monitoring and emergency management training programs led by Civil Protection, the University of El Salvador, and NGOs. The relocation effort, while effective at reducing physical vulnerability to debris flows, failed to incorporate livelihood, social networks, and cultural ties to homes in their project design and implementation. Since diverse livelihoods are keys to survival, and tightly-knit social networks help families share responsibilities and withstand shocks during hardships, many families returned to the high-risk area or opted not to relocate. Others have adapted using unanticipated strategies to benefit from the resettlement effort. On the other hand, the emergency management training and education programs valued local input, knowledge, and action, which has helped increase awareness and improved the overall capacity to manage emergencies through wide, local participation. The different approaches used in the two risk reduction initiatives reveal important lessons regarding the importance of community participation. Challenges derive from narrow understandings of vulnerability on the part of disaster risk reduction experts, who neglected to consider and understand kin networks and residence patterns that help maintain diverse livelihoods, as well as ensure safety and security. As demonstrated in the 2011 Tropical Depression 12E, effective public engagement and empowerment helped bridge the knowledge, awareness, and preparedness gaps that existed prior to the 2009 disaster. © 2015 Bowman and Henquinet.},

abstract={The insula and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) share functional, histological, transcriptional, and developmental characteristics, and they serve higher cognitive functions of theoretical relevance to schizophrenia and related disorders. Meta-analyses and multivariate analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans indicate that gray matter density and volume reductions in schizophrenia are the most consistent and pronounced in a network primarily composed of the insula and mPFC. We used source-based morphometry, a multivariate technique optimized for structural MRI, in a large sample of randomly ascertained pedigrees (N=887) to derive an insula-mPFC component and to investigate its genetic determinants. Firstly, we replicated the insula-mPFC gray matter component as an independent source of gray matter variation in the general population, and verified its relevance to schizophrenia in an independent case-control sample. Secondly, we showed that the neuroanatomical variation defined by this component is largely determined by additive genetic variation (h2=0.59), and genome-wide linkage analysis resulted in a significant linkage peak at 12q24 (LOD=3.76). This region has been of significant interest to psychiatric genetics as it contains the Darier's disease locus and other proposed susceptibility genes (e.g., DAO, NOS1), and it has been linked to affective disorders and schizophrenia in multiple populations. Thus, in conjunction with previous clinical studies, our data imply that one or more psychiatric risk variants at 12q24 are co-inherited with reductions in mPFC and insula gray matter concentration. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Privacy and information security in general are major concerns that impede enterprise adaptation of shared or public cloud computing. Specifically, the concern of virtual machine (VM) physical co-residency stems from the threat that hostile tenants can leverage various forms of side channels (such as cache covert channels) to exfiltrate sensitive information of victims on the same physical system. However, on virtualized x86 systems, covert channel attacks have not yet proven to be practical, and thus the threat is widely considered a 'potential risk.' In this paper, we present a novel covert channel attack that is capable of high-bandwidth and reliable data transmission in the cloud. We first study the application of existing cache channel techniques in a virtualized environment and uncover their major insufficiency and difficulties. We then overcome these obstacles by: 1) redesigning a pure timing-based data transmission scheme, and 2) exploiting the memory bus as a high-bandwidth covert channel medium. We further design and implement a robust communication protocol and demonstrate realistic covert channel attacks on various virtualized x86 systems. Our experimental results show that covert channels do pose serious threats to information security in the cloud. Finally, we discuss our insights on covert channel mitigation in virtualized environments. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Participation on Online Social Networks (OSNs) inherently requires information sharing and thus exposes individuals to privacy risks. Risk mitigation then has been encouraged through adoption of usable privacy controls. Apparently stronger privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) decrease both risk and perceptions of risk. As a result individuals feel safer and may respond by in fact accepting more risk. Such perverse results have been observed offline. Risk perception offline has been understood to be a function of characteristics of the risks involved rather than as a calculus grounded only in the probability of the risk and the magnitude of harm. In this work we use nine characteristics of risk from a classic and proven offline model of perceived risk to conduct a survey based evaluation of perceptions of privacy risks on Facebook. We find that these dimensions of risk provide a statistically significant explanation of perceived risk of information sharing on Facebook. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Climate change has become a priority issue since the beginning of the '90s, but binding agreements on GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emission reduction valid worldwide have not been reached yet. The European Union has been a forerunner on regional binding targets with its "20-20-20" Climate and Energy Package approved in 2009, followed in Dec. 2011 by more ambitious targets implying a dramatic reduction by 2050 of GHG emissions to 80-95% below 1990 levels.After a review of the present world situation with respect to primary energy resources, electricity production and CO2 emissions, the paper addresses the present and foreseen penetration of the power generation from RES (Renewable Energy Sources) in the EU (European Union), underlining also the economic impact on final clients caused by generous feed in tariffs.The impact of a substantial increase of RES generation both in power and energy on the power market operation and system reliability and security are presented with practical examples from the Italian situations; e.g.: distortion of the day-ahead power market prices, critical load following requirements for conventional plants, need for additional reserve and risk of excess of non-programmable generation ("overgeneration") in some hours, risk of dynamic stability and worsening of power quality.The main solutions to overcome the above problems are reviewed and a methodology developed by CESI is described explaining how to attain the maximum share of RES generation in a specific power system, in compliance with reliability and security standards.In authors'opinion, the technical and economic aspects must be treated together and it is mandatory to arrive quickly at agreed costs for the environmental impact of electrical infrastructures, particularly CO2 and other GHG emissions. Coherently, new RES generation and related network assets must be planned in an appropriate way to be a real asset and not a problem.},

abstract={This paper discusses progress in the design of the control, interlock and safety systems of the Tokamak Cooling Water System (TCWS) for the ITER fusion reactor. The TCWS instrumentation and control (I&C) is one of approximately 200 separate Plant I&C Systems (e.g., vacuum system I&C, magnets system I&C) that interface to a common Central I&C System through standardized networks. The TCWS consists of about 1100 process instruments (flow, pressure, temperature, level, analysis, etc.), and 83 signal conditioning cubicles (SCCs). Several aspects of the I&C are similar to the I&C of fission-based power plants. However, some of the unique features of the ITER fusion reactor and the TCWS (e.g., high quasi-static magnetic field, need for baking and drying as well as cooling operations), also demand some unique safety and qualification considerations. The paper compares the design strategy/guidelines of the TCWS I&C and the I&C of conventional nuclear power plants. Issues such as safety classifications, independence between control and safety systems, sensor sharing, redundancy, voting schemes, and equipment qualification methodologies are discussed. It is concluded that independence and separation requirements are similar in both designs. However, the voting schemes for safety systems in nuclear power plants typically use 2004 (i.e., 4 divisions of safety I&C, any 2 of which is sufficient to trigger a safety action), while 2003 voting logic - within each of 2 independent trains - is used in the TCWS I&C. It is also noted that 2003 voting is also acceptable in nuclear power plants if adequate risk assessment and reliability is demonstrated. Finally, while qualification requirements provide similar guidance [e.g., both IEC 60780 (invoked in ITER-space), and IEEE 323 (invoked in fission power plant space) provide similar guidance], an important qualification consideration is the susceptibility of I&C to the magnetic fields of ITER. Also, the radiation environments are different. In the case of magnetic fields the paper discusses some options that are being considered .},

abstract={Supported by the Web 3.0 platform that enables dynamic content sharing, social networking applications are a ubiquitous information exchange platform. Content sharing raises the question of privacy with concerns typically centered on vulnerabilities resulting in identity theft. Identifying privacy vulnerabilities is a challenging problem because mitigations are implemented at the end of the software development life cycle, sometimes resulting in severe vulnerabilities. The authors present a prototype experimental social networking platform (HACKMI2) as a case study for a comparative analysis of three popular industry threat-modeling approaches. They focus on identified vulnerabilities, risk impact, and mitigation strategies. The results indicate that software and/or asset-centric approaches provide only a high-level analysis of a system's architecture and are not as effective as attacker-centric models in identifying highrisk security vulnerabilities in a system. Furthermore, attacker-centric models are effective in providing security administrators useful suggestions for addressing security vulnerabilities. © 2014, IGI Global.},

abstract={Access to current application and network data is vital to cybersecurity and networking research. Intrusion detection, steganography, traffic camouflaging, traffic classification and modeling all benefit from real-world data. Such data provides training, testing, and evaluation as well as furthers efforts to reach ground truth. Currently available network data-especially data with application-level information-is often outdated and is either private or customized to specific, narrow research needs. The biggest hurdle to obtaining such content-rich data is addressing the huge privacy risks associated with sharing such complex and open-ended data. In this paper we present a data sharing system called Critter-at-Home which addresses these challenges. Critter connects end-users willing to share data with researchers and strikes a balance between privacy risks for a data contributor and utility for a researcher.

abstract={As a convenient, on-demand access service model for network based, configurable shared calculation resource pool, cloud computing has many advantages. At the same time, there are many challenges in the development and application of cloud computing, especially in cloud security. For quantification demand of cloud security services, drawing on cloud computing risk control security assess framework related to the international organizations, based on China's classification protection assessment requirements, the cloud computing security evaluation index system is built using of Delphi method, and the weight of each index entry is calculated using the AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process). The cloud security assessment model has been validated through examples, and the results show that the proposed model can make quantitative assessment on secure cloud platform effectively, with much more efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In the next decades, Electric Vehicles (EVs) are expected to gain increasing popularity and huge penetration in the automotive market, thanks to their potentialities for close interaction with the Smart Grid ecosystem. Firstly, recharging EV’s batteries with energy produced by renewables will allow for a consistent reduction of pollution due to the carbon emissions of traditional gasoline combustion; secondly, batteries could be exploited to store/inject energy from/to the grid in order to compensate the unpredictable fluctuations caused by Renewable Energy Sources (RES). To this aim, a load aggregator is envisioned as a scheduling entity to plan the EVs’ battery recharge/discharge according to the user’s needs and the current power generation of the grid. The main drawback of the introduction of such load aggregator is a potential harm of users’ privacy: gathering information about the EVs’ recharge requests and plug/unplug events could make the scheduler able to infer the private travelling habits of the customers, thus exposing them to the risk of tracking attacks and to other privacy threats. To address this issue, this paper proposes a security infrastructure for privacy-friendly Vehicle-to- Grid (V2G) interactions, which enables the load aggregator to schedule the EV’s battery charge/discharge without learning the current battery level, nor the amount of charged/discharged energy, nor the time periods in which the EVs are available for recharge. Our proposed scheduling protocol is based on the Shamir Secret Sharing scheme. We provide a security analysis of the privacy guarantees provided by our framework and compare its performance to the optimal schedule that would be obtained if the aggregator had full knowledge of the charging-related information. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={China is Asia's most important upstream riparian country, sharing 110 rivers and lakes with 18 downstream countries. Consequently, China's management of transboundary water resources must consider both environmental and geopolitical risks. The major threats to and conflicts over international rivers in China revolve around biotic homogenisation due to the installation of transport links, water allocation, water pollution, alteration of natural flow patterns and disruption of fisheries due to the installation of hydropower dams, and droughts and floods exacerbated by climate change. Because these problems have an international component, they fall under China's Peaceful Rise strategy, mandating that transboundary conflicts be resolved amicably as part of the overarching goal of increasing regional economic growth with as little conflict as possible. Science-backed policy is more likely to result in long term, mutually agreeable solutions; the results of applied ecological research have already resulted in a number of mitigation measures, including setting operational thresholds to reduce the downstream impact of dams, designating protected areas along key river stretches where dams cannot be installed (one dam in a critical location has been cancelled), and the installation of terrestrial protected-area networks. Synthesis and applications. Applied ecology will continue to play an important role in the diagnosis and resolution of environmental threats to China's transboundary waters. More importantly, applied ecology can inform the development of a transboundary environmental compensation mechanism and regional consultative mechanisms that support informed, cooperative decision-making for China and its riparian neighbours.

abstract={Privacy and security are major concerns for many users of social media. When users share information (e.g., data and photos) with friends, they can make their friends vulnerable to security and privacy breaches with dire consequences. With the continuous expansion of a user's social network, privacy settings alone are often inadequate to protect a user's profile. In this research, we aim to address some critical issues related to privacy protection: (1) How can we measure and assess individual users' vulnerability? (2) With the diversity of one's social network friends, how can one figure out an effective approach to maintaining balance between vulnerability and social utility? In this work, first we present a novel way to define vulnerable friends from an individual use's perspective. User vulnerability is dependent on whether or not the use's friends' privacy settings protect the friend and the individual's network of friends (which includes the user). We show that it is feasible to measure and assess user vulnerability and reduce one's vulnerability without changing the structure of a social networking site. The approach is to unfriend one's most vulnerable friends. However, when such a vulnerable friend is also socially important, unfriending him or her would significantly reduce one's own social status. We formulate this novel problem as vulnerability minimization with social utility constraints. We formally define the optimization problem and provide an approximation algorithm with a proven bound. Finally, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of a new framework using a Facebook dataset. We resort to experiments and observe how much vulnerability an individual user can be decreased by unfriending a vulnerable friend. We compare performance of different unfriending strategies and discuss the security risk of new friend requests. Additionally, by employing different forms of social utility, we confirm that the balance between user vulnerability and social utility can be practically achieved.

abstract={Objective: Bipolar I disorder is a highly heritable disorder but not all siblings manifest with the illness, even though they may share similar genetic and environmental risk factors. Thus, sibling studies may help to identify brain structural endophenotypes associated with risk and resistance for the disorder. Methods: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired for 28 euthymic patients with bipolar disorder, their healthy siblings, and 30 unrelated healthy controls. Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) was used to identify group differences in regional gray matter volume by voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Results: Using analysis of covariance, gray matter analysis of the groups revealed a group effect indicating that the left orbitofrontal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 11] was smaller in patients with bipolar disorder than in unrelated healthy controls [F = 14.83, p &lt; 0.05 (family-wise error); 7 mm3]. Paired t-tests indicated that the orbitofrontal cortex of patients with bipolar disorder [t = 5.19, p &lt; 0.05 (family-wise error); 37 mm3] and their healthy siblings [t = 3.89, p &lt; 0.001 (uncorrected); 63 mm3] was smaller than in unrelated healthy controls, and that the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was larger in healthy siblings than in patients with bipolar disorder [t = 4.28, p &lt; 0.001 (uncorrected); 323 mm3] and unrelated healthy controls [t = 4.36, p &lt; 0.001 (uncorrected); 245 mm3]. Additional region-of-interest analyses also found volume deficits in the right cerebellum of patients with bipolar disorder [t = 3.92, p &lt; 0.001 (uncorrected); 178 mm3] and their healthy siblings [t = 4.23, p &lt; 0.001 (uncorrected); 489 mm3], and in the left precentral gyrus of patients with bipolar disorder [t = 3.61, p &lt; 0.001 (uncorrected); 115 mm3] compared to unrelated healthy controls. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that a reduction in the volume of the orbitofrontal cortex, which plays a role in the automatic regulation of emotions and is a part of the medial prefrontal network, is associated with the heritability of bipolar disorder. Conversely, increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume may be a neural marker of a resistance factor as it is part of a network of voluntary emotion regulation and balances the effects of the disrupted automatic emotion regulation system. © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

abstract={Climate change is the one of the most challenging environmental problems facing people in Jordan, with far-reaching impacts on the economy, public health, water resources, infrastructure, coastal resources, energy demand, natural features and recreation (Davies, 1958). In Jordan, growing impacts of climate change also come at a time when water resources are already under stress due to existing scarcity that is magnified by demands from a growing population and rising per capita incomes. While Jordan has several projects under way, like the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal, to meet this demand for water, other adaptation measures could be taken to reduce the use of the nation’s renewable and non-renewable water. This chapter explores the potential utility of market institutions as a form of adaptation that can promote a sustainable future for water resources in Jordan and thus to help adapt to a potential reduction of water availability due to climate change and/or increased climate variability. Institutions, however, are often insufficient by themselves. The best adaptations and solutions may require changes in behaviour toward sustainable management practices of river basins. Ultimately, it is water user behaviour that will define the water profile consumption of a given region. In this light, sustainable changes are best achieved through a combination of widespread institutional adjustment as well as targeted local programmes. This chapter examines Jordan’s Azraq Basin in the Mafraq Governorate, which also includes parts of the Zarqa, Hamad and Sirhan Basins (Figure 19.1). It identifies economically efficient measures that could conserve water in irrigated agriculture, while also sustaining the growing urban water demands of nearby Amman. This map shows water basins in Jordan with the Azraq Basin in the middle, just east of Amman. Innovative solutions may have far-reaching applications. If effective institutions and behaviour adjustments are successful, they may be implemented in other countries to help adapt to water shortages abroad. As the global population is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050, innovations that influence the behaviour of water users will be necessary to balance global food security with increased stress on natural water endowments. It is also important to recognize that achieving sustainable water management will be difficult to balance with Jordan’s national goals of rural poverty reduction and national food security; Hope et al. (2008) identified similar policy conflicts between irrigation and urban water uses for South Africa, while Giordano (2007) and Han and Zhao (2007) observed this kind of conflict in China. Consequently, innovations in Jordan may provide useful examples for water user behaviour in other countries. When adaptation to climate variability disrupts livelihoods, science becomes part of the political debate. Even in the status quo, population and climate pressures are increasing the competition for fresh water (Aggarwal, 2000; Akpabio, 2007; Ward, 2007). Nowhere is this more striking than in the Middle East (Arar, 1991; AlWeshah, 2000; Salman et al., 2008). Jordan, a mostly landlocked country bordering Palestine, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria, has been plagued by water scarcity since ancient times (Brooks, 1993; Scott et al., 2003; Mohsen, 2007). Due to its dry climate and scant rainfall, water scarcity is still a serious environmental challenge facing Jordan (Figure 19.2) and is a central factor defining, promoting and limiting Jordan’s population, resources and economy. For example, more than 90 per cent of Jordan’s land area receives less than 200 mm of rainfall per year (Chebaane et al., 2004; Al-Kharabsheh and Ta’any, 2005). While water resources in Jordan have either stagnated or varied incrementally each year, its population continues to rise. A high rate of natural population growth, combined with sporadic large inflows of refugees, has altered the balance between population and water. The old balance, which lasted to 1950, has gradually changed to a chronic and worsening imbalance. Jordan’s water situation is challenged by the constraint that Jordan shares much of its surface water resources with neighbouring countries, whose control limits Jordan’s supplies (Ramirez et al., 2010). Excessive pumping from the Jordan aquifer by Israel exerts pressure on Jordan’s groundwater resources, while accelerated well and dam building in Syria has reduced the amount of water flowing south on the Yarmouk River (Humpal et al., 2012). Jordan’s major water resources are groundwater, surface water and treated wastewater effluent. The total renewable safe yield of groundwater resources in all of Jordan is an estimated 275 million cubic metres (MCM) per year. Water use from these renewable sources has exceeded the safe renewable supplies by more than 200 MCM per year in recent years, a pattern that cannot be sustained without water imports, recycling, reuse, virtual water or reduced demand (Ramirez et al., 2010). Jordan’s water scarcity will present growing technical and policy challenges over the next two decades as the forecasted population doubles, living standards rise (Alkhaddar et al., 2005; Jordan Ministry of Water and Irrigation, 2009) and climate change risks result in increasingly uncertain and variable precipitation. Furthermore, because many of Jordan’s poor are migrating to urban areas, these people face growing food and water insecurity (Faruqui and Al-Jayyousi, 2002). Additionally, high domestic water demands are exacerbated by large numbers of foreigners in Jordan. According to a March 2008 report by the Integrated Regional Information Networks of the United Nations (IRIN, 2008) the arrival of 500,000 Iraqi refugees since 2003 has compounded Jordan’s water problem. Jordan also hosts nearly 300,000 Egyptian guest workers, 200,000 Syrians and other expatriates, including an estimated 167,000 Palestinian refugees. As a result of the civil war in neighbouring Syria, more than 550,000 Syrian refugees are also in Jordan (UNHCR, 2013). Increased urban water demand, poor management by current well-users, expensive profit-for-drop irrigation measures, increased salinity from industrial runoff and climate change all compound these problems. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) estimates show that, within the next few decades, Jordan’s annual water resources per capita are expected to fall to just 90 m3 (Humpal et al., 2012). As climate change is expected to raise the average temperature in Jordan uniformly by 3°C in the winter and 4.5°C in the summer, with no marked change in precipitation (Harrison, 2009), drought conditions will magnify this scarcity, reduce available urban water supply and disproportionately harm rural agricultural and grazing communities who need reliable rainfall to grow crops and raise livestock. Jordan has recently examined numerous measures for coping with these shortages: in December 2013, a MoU was signed with Israel and Palestine to implement the first phase of the Red Sea-Dead Sea Water Conveyance Project in order to tackle the chronic water shortage. The Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal Project will convey water by canal from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea and provide 850 MCM of potable water after desalination. The project is aimed to assist the Dead Sea, the water level of which has been falling since the 1960s (Akash and Mohsen, 1998; Salman et al., 2001), mostly as a result of upstream surface water diversions and industrial evaporation ponds. One important new source of water to help alleviate water shortages in Amman is the USS1 billion Disi Water Project (Figure 19.3). Originally contracted in October 2007, it includes construction of a 325 km pipeline that will pump water from the Disi aquifer to Amman (Enerji, 2009). However, without major changes, these proposed projects have been called merely ‘breathing space’ that will, in the end, fail to meet the ‘ever-growing water deficit that looms on the 18-20 year time horizon’ (Humpal et al., 2012). Jordan’s Azraq Aquifer accounts for a large part of its underground water resources (Bajjali and Al-Hadidi, 2006). As of 2010, most of the extraction was devoted to irrigation through pumping, as previously approved by Jordan’s government. While the government may have legal authority to rescind some or all of the pumping permits, farmers view the permits as long-term water rights. In light of these debates, policy makers have considerable interest in any information concerning what factors influence water use and water use efficiency by farmers who pump from this aquifer. Policy and decision makers also need information that can help meet the needs of individual farmers, as well as help inform better water policy choices. Because the Azraq Aquifer is close to Amman, a major policy objective in regard to the aquifer is to examine the economic feasibility of water transfers by reallocating pumping from irrigation to urban water use to support Amman’s growth. This increased pressure on agricultural water use in Jordan comes at a time when rural poverty reduction and national food security are major national goals. An important water policy aim of Jordan is to minimize the economic impact on farmers and on the overall economic welfare of this region’s people, resulting from the increased water conservation that will be required of irrigated agriculture (Doppler et al., 2002. © 2015 Dominic Stucker and Elena Lopez-Gunn.},

abstract={We present the observation of distributed denial-of-service attacks that use reflection of the flooding traffic off reflectors. This type of attack was used in massive attacks against internet infrastructure of Czech Republic in March, 2013. Apart from common hosts in the network, honeypots were abused as the reflectors. It caused the false positive incident detection and helped attackers. Honeypots, which are by default set to accept any incoming network connection, unintentionally amplified the effect of reflection. We present an analysis of the attack from the point of view of honeypots and show the risks of having honeypots respond to any incoming traffic. We also discuss the possibilities of attack detection and mitigation and present lessons learned from handling the attack. We point out a lack of communication and data sharing during the observed attack. © 2013 Authors.},

abstract={The ability to stay connected with friends online and share information, has accounted for the popularity of online social networking websites. However, the overwhelming task of access control policy management for information shared on these websites has resulted in various mental models of sharing with a false sense of privacy. The misalignment between a user's intended and actual privacy settings causes access control misconfigurations, raising the risk of unintentional privacy leaks. In this paper, we propose a scheme to extract the user's mental model of sharing, enhance this model using information learned from their existing policies, and enable them to compose misconfiguration free policies. We present the possible misconfiguration patterns based on which we scan the Facebook user's access control policies. We implemented a prototype Facebook application of our scheme and conducted a pilot study using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our preliminary results show that the users' intended policies were significantly different than their actual policies. Our scheme was able to detect the misconfiguration patterns in album policies. However, the reduction in the number of misconfigurations after using our approach was not significant. Participants' perceptions of our proposed policy misconfiguration patterns and the usability of our scheme was positive.},

abstract={This article summarizes a process which exemplifies the potential impact of municipal investment on the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in city populations. We report on Developing an evidence-based approach to city public health planning and investment in Europe (DECiPHEr), a project part funded by the European Union. It had twin objectives: first, to develop and validate a vocational educational training package for policy makers and political decision takers; second, to use this opportunity to iterate a robust and user-friendly investment tool for maximizing the public health impact of 'mainstream' municipal policies, programs and investments. There were seven stages in the development process shared by an academic team from Sheffield Hallam University and partners from four cities drawn from the WHO European Healthy Cities Network. There were five iterations of the model resulting from this process. The initial focus was CVD as the biggest cause of death and disability in Europe. Our original prototype 'cost offset' model was confined to proximal determinants of CVD, utilizing modified 'Framingham' equations to estimate the impact of population level cardiovascular risk factor reduction on future demand for acute hospital admissions. The DECiPHEr iterations first extended the scope of the model to distal determinants and then focused progressively on practical interventions. Six key domains of local influence on population health were introduced into the model by the development process: education, housing, environment, public health, economy and security. Deploying a realist synthesis methodology, the model then connected distal with proximal determinants of CVD. Existing scientific evidence and cities' experiential knowledge were 'plugged-in' or 'triangulated' to elaborate the causal pathways from domain interventions to public health impacts. A key product is an enhanced version of the cost offset model, named Sheffield Health Effectiveness Framework Tool, incorporating both proximal and distal determinants in estimating the cost benefits of domain interventions. A key message is that the insights of the policy community are essential in developing and then utilising such a predictive tool. © 2012 The New York Academy of Medicine.},

abstract={Connecting Organizations for Regional Disease Surveillance (CORDS) is an international non-governmental organization focused on information exchange between disease surveillance networks in different areas of the world. By linking regional disease surveillance networks, CORDS builds a trust-based social fabric of experts who share best practices, surveillance tools and strategies, training courses, and innovations. CORDS exemplifies the shifting patterns of international collaboration needed to prevent, detect, and counter all types of biological dangers - not just naturally occurring infectious diseases, but also terrorist threats. Representing a network-of-networks approach, the mission of CORDS is to link regional disease surveillance networks to improve global capacity to respond to infectious diseases. CORDS is an informal governance cooperative with six founding regional disease surveillance networks, with plans to expand; it works in complement and cooperatively with theWorld Health Organization (WHO), theWorld Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Animal Organization of the United Nations (FAO). As described in detail elsewhere in this special issue of Emerging Health Threats, each regional network is an alliance of a small number of neighboring countries working across national borders to tackle emerging infectious diseases that require unified regional efforts. Here we describe the history, culture and commitment of CORDS; and the novel and necessary role that CORDS serves in the existing international infectious disease surveillance framework. © 2013 Louise S.

abstract={Background: Recently, a growing number of neuroimaging studies have begun to investigate the brains of schizophrenic patients and their healthy siblings to identify heritable biomarkers of this complex disorder. The objective of this study was to use multiclass pattern analysis to investigate the inheritable characters of schizophrenia at the individual level, by comparing whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity of patients with schizophrenia to their healthy siblings.Methods: Twenty-four schizophrenic patients, twenty-five healthy siblings and twenty-two matched healthy controls underwent the resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) scanning. A linear support vector machine along with principal component analysis was used to solve the multi-classification problem. By reconstructing the functional connectivities with high discriminative power, three types of functional connectivity-based signatures were identified: (i) state connectivity patterns, which characterize the nature of disruption in the brain network of patients with schizophrenia; (ii) trait connectivity patterns, reflecting shared connectivities of dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia and their healthy siblings, thereby providing a possible neuroendophenotype and revealing the genetic vulnerability to develop schizophrenia; and (iii) compensatory connectivity patterns, which underlie special brain connectivities by which healthy siblings might compensate for an increased genetic risk for developing schizophrenia. Results: Our multiclass pattern analysis achieved 62.0% accuracy via leave-one-out cross-validation (p < 0.001). The identified state patterns related to the default mode network, the executive control network and the cerebellum. For the trait patterns, functional connectivities between the cerebellum and the prefrontal lobe, the middle temporal gyrus, the thalamus and the middle temporal poles were identified. Connectivities among the right precuneus, the left middle temporal gyrus, the left angular and the left rectus, as well as connectivities between the cingulate cortex and the left rectus showed higher discriminative power in the compensatory patterns. Conclusions: Based on our experimental results, we saw some indication of differences in functional connectivity patterns in the healthy siblings of schizophrenic patients compared to other healthy individuals who have no relations with the patients. Our preliminary investigation suggested that the use of resting-state functional connectivities as classification features to discriminate among schizophrenic patients, their healthy siblings and healthy controls is meaningful. © 2013 Yu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The sharp increase of smartphone malwares has become one of the most serious security problems. The most significant part of the growth is the variants of existing malwares. A legacy approach for malware, the signature matching, is efficient in temporal dimension, but it is not practical because of its lack of robustness against the variants. A counter approach, the behavior analysis to handle the variant issue, takes too much time and resources. We propose a variant detection mechanism using runtime semantic signature. Our key idea is to reduce the control and data flow analysis overhead by using binary patterns for the control and data flow of critical actions as a signature. The flow information is a significant part of behavior analysis but takes high analysis overhead. In contrast to the previous behavioral signatures, the runtime semantic signature has higher family classification accuracy without the flow analysis overhead, because the binary patterns of flow parts is hardly shared by the out of family members. Using the proposed signature, we detect the new variants of known malwares by static matching efficiently and accurately. We evaluated our mechanism with 1,759 randomly collected real-world Android applications including 79 variants of 4 malware families. As the experimental result, our mechanism showed 99.89% of accuracy on variant detection. We also showed that the mechanism has a linear time complexity as the number of target applications. It is fully practical and advanced performance than the previous works in both of accuracy and efficiency. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract={Fast growth in installed capacity of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES - mainly wind turbines and photovoltaic) as well as increasing market-based cross-border flows and related physical flows are leading to rising uncertainties in transmission network operation and decreasing of operational security (basic N-1 criterion is sometimes observed with difficulties). At the same time an efficient and sustainable electricity system requires an efficient usage of existing and planned transmission capacities (taking into account difficulties to build new infrastructure like overhead lines). New interconnections (HVDC) and devices for load flow control (phase-shifting transformers PST) will be integrated in future transmission networks and will offer new operational options. Newly applied methods have to take into account all technological measures to enhance flexibility of power system operations (real-time monitoring of thermal line ratings) as well. Several projects are designed for coping with these challenging issues. Proposed paper deals with one of them - named UMBRELLA (http://www.e-umbrella.eu/). The UMBRELLA is a research and demonstration project and it is carried out with the support of the European Union in the 7th Framework programme ENERGY.2011.7.2-1 (Innovative tools for the future coordinated and stable operation of the pan-European electricity transmission system). The projects started in January 2012 and will take four years to complete. Full name of the project is “Toolbox for Common Forecasting, Risk Assessment, and Operational Optimization in Grid Security Cooperation of Transmission System Operators (TSOs)”. Developed toolbox will enable TSOs to ensure secure grid operation also in future networks with high penetration of intermittent renewables. The first of the three main objectives of the project is to develop a dedicated innovative toolbox to support the grid security approach of TSOs, which shall include: a. simulation of uncertainties due to market activities and renewables on different time scales from day-ahead to real time, b. optimization of corrective actions in reaction to simulated risks on different time scales according to total costs and transmission capacities in the whole system, c. development of risk based assessment concepts for anticipated system states with and without corrective actions. The functionality of the toolbox would be demonstrated using appropriate test cases. TSOs in the Central East Europe (CEE) region are significantly afflicted by the increasing share of infeed from renewable energy sources. Special attention should be paid to cases with a high infeed of renewables resulting in stressed grid situations that require remedial actions like reduction of transmission capacities offered on the electricity market, redispatch of sources or network reconfigurations. This paper describes one case of such stressed grid situation, which happened last year and which could be used for testing of developed toolbox. Effort of TSOs to cope with this stressed situation and dynamic behaviour of the network is briefly described. Results of calculations carried out by network simulator (based on initial state and scenario of events) are presented as well. © 2013 CIGRE. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Multi-Level Security (MLS) is often viewed as the holy grail of information security, especially in those environments where information of different classifications is being processed. In this paper we argue that MLS cannot facilitate the right balance between need-to-protect and duty-to-share as required for a Network Enabled Capability (NEC) based military operations. This is due to the fact that MLS is deemed rigid in its restrictions; it obstructs the flow of information towards lower classifications by definition and thus influences duty-to-share; furthermore MLS results in a set of rigid preconditions for the physical environment to guarantee the required need-to-protect. The focus of a security solution instead should be on flexibility towards information sharing and reducing risks to be useful in a NEC environment. This can be achieved by firstly reducing the size (and complexity) of the systems that contain the classified information systems, using Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) to create these smaller, separated compartments; and secondly controlling the information flow between the (different) classified compartments by dynamic policies. Moreover, the realignment of classification provisions can make management of information much more flexible and efficient. Hence, we can finally forget MLS.},

abstract={Planetary rover missions have thus far performed in relatively benign environments to prevent loss of expensive hardware in risky, but potentially more scientifically valuable environments. Mission risk can be reduced by using micro-rover scouts that map the terrain prior to the main mission. However, micro-rovers will have more limited power and computation ability than their larger counterparts. Kapvik, a Canadian micro- rover, shares these power and computation constraints. This paper explores methods of implementing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using a laser range finder and stereo cameras on Kapvik along with inerlial sensors including gyroscopes, accelerometers, a sun sensor and wheel encoders. To perform SLAM in outdoor and unstructured environments 6 degree-of-freedom SLAM is usually required, where the complete pose of the rover is estimated along with the 3D position of its environment. This is a computationally expensive problem to run in an online fashion. The FastSLAM algorithm has been selected for Kapvik's navigation due to its efficiency, scalability, and robustness. The performance of a novel modification of the FastSLAM algorithm using the nonlinear Cubaturc Kalman Filter is compared with other implementations of the FastSLAM algorithm. The modification also makes use of the inertial sensors aboard Kapvik to improve its localization between scans of its environment with either the laser or camera. By increasing the pose estimation accuracy between scans the number of times laser or camera data must be processed is reduced. For initial testing of the SLAM algorithms a simulation environment is developed. This includes a 3D motion model for the Kapvik micro-rover which incorporates an articulated rocker-bogie chassis driving over uneven terrain including wheel slip as an external input. Mapping sensors such as a laser range finder and the inertia! sensors that sense the rover's motion are also simulated in addition to terrain being randomly generated that represents a planetary surface for the rover to traverse. Finally, the implementation of the algorithm on actual Kapvik hardware is outlined and the process to validate the results is discussed. The standard operation of the rover's navigation system including the autonomous decision process to take a scan as it drives along a specifed path is also presented. Testing using the Kapvik micro- rover demonstrates the importance of Earth analogue missions as precursors to missions to Mars. Copyright© (2012) by the International Astronautical Federation.},

abstract={Current power systems have been undergoing in depth changes by the increasing share of renewable generation. At one hand, the grid is progressively more interconnected in order to collect the renewable generation from geographically dispersed places and to reduce the risks of intermittency; on the other hand, the power is increasingly generated at relative low voltage networks which in turn gives rise to new challenges in the conventional system design. The ambitious Danish governmental objective of greenhouse gas reduction accelerates adoptation of the renewables. The effect of this has to be carefully evaluated to secure the operation at both transmission and distribution levels. The fluctuations from wind and solar may rapidly degradate the security of the system such as overloading, voltage stability issues, etc. The Danish SOSPO project is launched from 2012 targeting at the system security assessment in the control room for the future scenarios. Methods will be developed in this project to counteract with the future challenges, and a testing platform will be developed in the laboratory for algorithm testing and demonstration.},

abstract={This paper investigates the requirements, technologies and risk mitigation techniques for securely sharing information with the tactical Mobile users while protecting the data and the information systems from intruders and malware. The systems engineering concepts applied to the design and development of the Enterprise need to include the security criteria and mitigating techniques to handle Mobility, and reliance on Cloud services to obtain the required data and services. A strong emphasis is placed on analyzing secure data sharing outside its security domain with services, agencies, coalition partners and state/local authorities. There has been an increased demand for multiple levels of secretive data at the tactical edge; however the threat level at that point has been increasing dramatically compared to the enterprise environment. The next generation information systems need to eliminate the stovepipe architectures and open the doors to share information across traditional and non-traditional domain boundaries, while dealing with the increased threats stemming from wireless attacks, virtualized resources, and limited investment. This leads the sponsoring organization to think in terms of System of Systems when developing independent capabilities that needs to operate as consumers or producers with other systems. Agility in development is also paramount in today's budget sensitive and fluid requirements environments.},

abstract={Military organizations and commercial companies greatly depend on satellite communications and non-terrestrial data transfers for day-to-day business and warfare requirements. To reduce launch and production costs, militaries have adopted the use of commercial (corporate-owned) satellites, sharing available bandwidth and capabilities. Many of these commercial and military SATCOM assets are not protected from network and radio frequency (RF) attacks by adversaries using open-source and publically-available resources; operating from within developed or developing countries. Recent events have demonstrated that sophisticated military communication (MILCOM) satellites can be effortlessly compromised using low-cost equipment and radios available from commercial sources. Both digital and analogue signals can be captured, manipulated, and/or transmitted with little or no risk to the offending red forces, and low-cost global positioning system (GPS) jamming devices can be used to frustrate blue forces. Open-source programs for SATCOM transponders are available for download via hobbyist, equipment vendors, and black hat web sites with documentation and other resources for research and manipulation by red forces. Furthermore, red forces can utilize blue force SATCOM and MILSAT assets as a dependable and secure means for covert back-channel data and voice communications, increasing their ability to relay information while decreasing their detectable digital footprint. This paper identifies and demonstrates current open-source and publically-available capabilities for red teams assessing blue force SATCOM assets, to include: Identifying potential SATCOM and MILSAT targets Unauthorized use of satellite capabilities (covert communications) Uplink/downlink jamming and denial of service attacks Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and Commandeering of SATCOM signals Eavesdropping Malware development and delivery using resources available on black hat and Hamm radio hobbyist web sites This paper concludes by identifying vulnerabilities associated with currently deployed commercial and military satellite systems based solely on opensource and publically-available resources. The authors will conclude by presenting possible solutions for future SATCOM and MILSAT security.},

abstract={Cloud computing is changing the IT delivery model to provide on-demand self-service access to a shared pool of computing resources (physical and virtual) via broad network access to offer reduced costs, scalability, flexibility, capacity utilization, higher efficiencies and mobility. In many instances cloud computing builds on the capabilities of a virtualized computing infrastructure enabling multi-tenancy, scalability and a highly abstracted cloud model. Even though cloud computing provides compelling benefits and cost-effective options for IT hosting and expansion, security of applications and data remains a number one business objective. It is therefore essential to ensure adequate security not only for cloud computing, but also for the underlying technologies enabling cloud computing. Management should understand and analyse risks in order to safeguard systems and data. The focus of this paper is on mitigation for virtualization security risks as a fundamental step towards secure cloud computing environments.},

abstract={According to the classification of business activities in the National Classification of Activities, agriculture, forestry and fishery together account for 3.43% of all injuries recorded in 2009, which places them in the lower part of the annual review (Table 1). However, in the said group, the state forestry enterprise (Croatian Forests Ltd. Zagreb) accounts for 48.46% of all injuries at work, which makes 1.66% of all injuries recorded in 2009. Comparing the number of injuries in Croatian forests with the number of employees in 2009, an exceptionally high ratio is obtained of29.40 injuries per 1000 employees, the highest index among the above said industry sectors. Nevertheless, according to standard indicators of the level of security and protection of workers, in this decade forestry has recorded positive trends in relation to key indicators. Also, the state forestry enterprise halved the number of injuries (Table 2). Working techniques of workers directly employed in forest operations play a key role in achieving a satisfactory degree of safety and efficiency in forestry work. The assessment of working techniques of forest workers employed in logging and timber production has been carried out by the Faculty of Forestry continuously since 2000 (Table 3). Findings of a ten-year evaluation indicate the following: ⇒ since the beginning of monitoring, a relatively steady increasing trend of the level of working techniques has been recorded, while the accomplished potential (AP), calculated using the overall mean scores, has ranged between 0.79 and 0.88 utilizations, ⇒ mean value of AP is 0.84, which suggests an average of 16% of unaccomplished potential and it is a scope to improve working techniques, ⇒ rating of 2010 (2.63) keeps the increasing trend of working techniques levels, but such a positive difference is not statistically significant, ⇒ a decreasing trend of the lowest ratings (1) stops in 2010, by reducing the share of medium grade (2) and increasing the proportion of top grade (3). The evaluation of mechanized skidding has been carried out since 2008 by separate monitoring of the skidder-driver and chokerman (Table 4). Key findings are as follows: ⇒ performance level of work activities moderately grows with a decrease of the weakest ratings (1) and with the increase of the share of medium grade (2), ⇒ mean value of the accomplished potential (AP) amounts to 0.825 in 2009, which means an average of 17.5% of unaccomplished potential and it is a scope for improvement of working techniques. According to the Forests Act, forestry work can be carried out exclusively by registered and licensed contractors. According to the review of the Croatian Chamber of Forestry and Wood Technology of November 2010, there are 238 forestry contractors registered with license. It is evident that more than 85% of all licensed service contractors are engaged in logging, silviculture, and construction of forest roads (Table 6). Past practice of training for professional forest work shows that the greatest problems are related to: ⇒ uneven and incomplete programs and subject-matter training, ⇒ a significant reduction, even lack of practical training, ⇒ application of non-transparent training evaluation criteria. Additionally, training is conducted by programs that are not verified or independently assessed, and also there is no control of adequacy of human and technical resources for training. Also, it is not known that anyone has ever been denied to organize the training, e.g. for lack of specific resources and training ground for practical work. Also, Croatian forestry has no compulsory certification of operators of forestry machinery.There is no organized training of forest owners for forest work in Croatia. The first step in building such a system started with training 17 professionals by the Forestry Extension Service during 2008 at the Faculty of Forestry, University of Zagreb, where they were trained as trainers of safety in forestry work. In future, they should be mediators between forest owners who are interested in independent forest operations and educational training centers. During 2009, 6 experts of the Forestry Extension Services went through training in the Secondary Forestry School in Karlovac by which they were trained to implement the theoretical part of the training of forest owners for forest work. A part of practical training of forest owners was planned to be carried out in the polygon of the Secondary Forestry School in Karlovac. Interest in training for independent forest operations was shown by more than 500 forest owners. The Faculty of Forestry in Zagreb developed the idea of establishing a National Center for forest work. The center is envisioned as an agency with public authorities and international accreditation for certification of training for forest work and for work with specific tools such as chainsaw (Fig. 2). The idea of the Center was first included in the project proposal of the National Program for occupational safety in forestry 2007. The primary tasks of the Center would be as follows: ⇒ connecting Croatia into European processes and programs related to safety in forestry, ⇒ establishing a collaborative network in order to implement the EU-project standard of forest workers in Croatia, ⇒ introduction of certification of all aspects of training for professional work (Fig. 1), including forest certification program, performance and contractor training, ⇒ introduction of certification for training of non-professionals (especially forest owners) to work with chainsaw, ⇒ verification procedures in licensing of registered forestry contractors, ⇒ monitoring of the minimum technical requirements for training polygons, ⇒ establishment of an IT system for providing security with a registry of certificates issued. Considering the current legislative context, the Center for Forest Work should be formed as an agency with public authorities. The framework for the establishment and functioning of the Center should be created by alterations of the »Ordinance on occupational safety in forestry«. This ordinance should impose an obligation of training certification for all holders of such activities in the forestry sector. The establishment of a Center would also stimulate training market development, where it would be important to observe the above said rules in determining the qualifications and minimum requirements for legal and natural persons engaged in training for forest work. In the preparatory phase, cooperation and partnership should be initiated by the signing of agreements regarding the establishment and start-up of the Center between the respective ministry, the Croatian Forests Ltd., Faculty of Forestry, and the Croatian Forest Research Institute - primarily for integrating human and technical resources. The forthcoming Center would be financed from the state budget for its public activities (e.g. implementation of IT system) and income earned from its own collection of fees from holders of certifications and/or licenses.},

abstract={The petroleum-derived products produced by PETROBRAS are transported through an extensive network of oil and gas pipelines buried along distinctive right-of-ways, linking the PETROBRAS refineries and terminals. TRANSPETRO is the PETROBRAS Company in charge of the transport of these products as well as the maintenance of the integrity of these pipelines. The right-of-way travels across urban and country areas, receiving distinctive environmental and social impact from these regions, adding to the complexity of maintenance, thus creating a need for considering many variables where the environment plays a major rule. This paper has the objective of presenting studies and solutions developed by the São Paulo ROW Maintenance Crew, developed specifically on the ROWs under the jurisdiction of the Terminals of Guarulhos e Guararema. These studies focus on improvements in the functionality of the ROW, considering specific needs from each region as well as the environmental aspects that directly affects the maintenance of these ROWs, adding to the integrity of the pipeline network. The studies points to major changes on the undergoing maintenance processes, ranging from the replacement of the existent vegetation cover to the construction of linear and small parks seeking improvement on the environmental and social aspects of the ROW and its sourroundings. The development of small parks over the ROW area, where the surroundings are heavily populated has proven to be a successful method for maintenance cost reduction, and on the improvement of the relationship between TRANSPETRO and the Community. The knowledge sharing with the Community also adds to the enhancement of operational safety. The small parks developed to meet the expectations of the Community have experienced a drastic reduction of the volume unauthorized trash and construction debris disposal. The communities preserve the park, acting as a ROW inspector element, raising the bar of the pipeline operational security. As for the countryside, one of the challenges is the hilly surface that favors occurrence of erosive processes on and under the surface of the track, as well as on public and private accesses and sedimentation of rivers, lakes and proprieties, causing negative impact to the company's public image. Thus, the surface drainage design must balance the impact on the surroundings with the removal of the water flow over the ROW. Another main aspect that should be considered on countryside ROW are the species used for vegetal cover, not always appropriate to the local soil. Sometimes it grows too rapidly, generating huge quantities of cuttings, making it difficult to properly inspect and maintain the ROW, increasing the risk of accidents. The appropriate vegetal cover is better defined through experimentation on different locations, testing various species, such as grasses, herbs, fodder shrubs or consortium of different species. In short, this paper seeks to establish a standard on ROW maintenance that focus on the integrity of the pipeline and on the reducing of the environmental impacts caused by it, by improving the drainage design and replacing the existent vegetal cover, thus reducing maintenance costs and establishing a healthy relationship with the surrounding communities.

The proposed approach requires not only generating inventories of acquiring organizations' equipment and software products, and clear and detailed descriptions of every link in the supply chain, but also the identification of common components and their sources. This information is required not only for manufacturer and OEM supply chains, but also for the services supply chains of maintenance and repair organizations. When such critical components and services have been identified, one must prioritize their importance and apply appropriate security and testing. Such an identification and tracking system is only as good as its ability to incorporate up-to-the-minute changes and additions. This requires extensive real-time reporting and information sharing.

abstract={This paper reports results from a case study on household food insecurity needs and the interventions that address them. It aimed at comparing households' perceptions on food insecurity experience and vulnerability to those of other stakeholders: community workers, programme managers and representatives from donor agencies. Semi-structured interviews with 55 households and 59 other stakeholders were conducted. Content analysis was performed, using a framework encompassing food sufficiency, characterization of household food insecurity and vulnerability of households to food insecurity. Overall, the results draw attention to a gap between households and the other stakeholders, where the later do not seem always able to assess the realities of food-insecure households. Other areas of divergences include: characteristics of food insecurity, relative importance of various risk factors related to food insecurity and the effectiveness of the community assistance to enhance the households' ability to face food insecurity. These divergent perceptions may jeopardize the implementation of sustainable solutions to food insecurity. Training of stakeholders for a better assessment of households' experience and needs, and systematic evaluation of interventions, appear urgent and highly relevant for an adequate response to households' needs. Collaboration between all stakeholders should lead to knowledge sharing and advocacy for policies dedicated to poverty reduction. © 2009 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract={Introduction As many as 400 people may have access to one's personal medical information throughout the typical care process. Disclosures of sensitive information such as emotional problems, sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, and genetic predispositions to diseases-could cause embarrassment and affect insurability, child custody cases, and employment. A recent survey by IDC found that "Most consumers were uncomfortable with their health plan sharing health information with a hospital, a specialist or their primary care doctor (and) were concerned with who saw their information and were worried that the information could be made available online (and) other respondents said they didn't trust their health plan or hospital to protect their information." Clearly, patients (consumers) feel that it is critical that their medical information is held in confidence. If patients do not feel that their personal medical information will be kept confidential, they may withhold important medical information from health care providers making it difficult to provide quality and effective health care. This issue of safeguarding sensitive patient information has become even more critical given that the Electronic Protected Health Information (PHI), in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), may consist of a patient's medical, demographic and insurance information. Thus, presenting a significant information assurance and security challenge to the health care industry as reflected by the consumers' concerns related to building trust with health care community. If the health care industry falls behind in assuring the public that it can indeed safeguard patient information, then the initiative to create a more efficient and cost effective health care system by using Information Technology will be in serious jeopardy. The research presented in this article addresses this important information assurance and security challenge by building upon past research and presenting a framework of Information Assurance and Compliance developed through multi-site case study approach involving multiple health care providers in the U.S. Mercuri correctly identified that "solutions (to the information assurance challenge) are not as simple as adding on security tools and providing employees with policies and procedures for their job classification and requiring them to read and sign off on them." Information Assurance (IA) technologies such as encryption, password protection, access control mechanisms, and so on, for PHI may not be sufficient, since not all individual health care professionals may be familiar with the requirements of the law nor sufficiently motivated or trained to protect private and sensitive patient information. Health care Information Assurance policy (IA Policy) may be in place due to HIPPA requirements, but if health care employees fail to comply with such policy then patient information will be at a risk for disclosure. In this context, Mercuri correctly underscores the importance of human and management factors related to compliance by stating that "the workers (must be given) a sufficient period in which to incorporate the new structures and rules into their culture and ethics. Otherwise efforts (related to IA Policy compliance) may be frustrated and unsuccessful." Even though human and management factors, related to compliance, have been recognized as important as technical factors in providing security to PHI in the health care industry, there is a lack of well-developed framework to understand IA policy compliance factors addressing the behavioral dimension in the context of patient health care information. Without such a framework, it is difficult to develop both managerial interventions and research studies in this important area of health care information assurance. The purpose of this research (using multi-site case research approach) is to present such a research framework that examines what factors affect health care employee's behavior to comply with information assurance (IA) policy related to protection of patient health care information. We also present sample measures to assess individual compliance. In the light of recent breaches and/ or theft of sensitive consumer data from banking, academic institutions, government agencies, and health care providers, this study provides a framework that can be extended and adapted to understand IA Policy issues in health care as well as in other industries. Therefore, the implication of this study is much broader and can be extended to other industries with appropriate adaptation. The unifying foundation for our research framework is the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). TRA posits that external factors affect beliefs and beliefs in turn affect attitudes, and attitudes affect intention which ultimately affect one's behavior. We examine how these concepts are related to one's behavior in complying with information assurance policy regarding patient health information. Using TRA, we build our framework on solid theoretical foundations drawing from research in technology acceptance model, information assurance and security, ethical behavior, organizational culture4 and health information management. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Dietary- and lifestyle-related diseases are problems of epidemic proportion in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Public health resources to help prevent nutrition-related problems are limited. There is also concern about biodiversity, neglect of traditional staple foods, and threatened loss of traditional knowledge. A "Go Local" campaign was initiated to increase production and consumption of locally grown foods, for their Culture, Health, Environment, Economics, and Food security ("CHEEF") benefits. To provide updates and discuss local island food topics, the Island Food Community of Pohnpei launched an interagency email network in 2003. Interested members' email addresses were recorded in distribution lists, weekly/bi-weekly emails were sent and from these messages, a database was organized to record email topic details. An analysis of all emails up to July 2009 showed that membership had expanded to over 600 listed people from all FSM states, other Pacific Island countries and beyond. Information was shared on topics ranging from scientific findings of carotenoid content in local island food cultivars, to discussions on how daily habits related to island food use can be improved. Over 200 men and women, aged 22 to 80 years, contributed items, some indicating that they had shared emails to a further network at their workplace or community. In conclusion, this email network is a simple, cost-effective method to share information, create awareness, and mobilize island food promotion efforts with potential for providing health, biodiversity and other benefits of island foods to populations in the FSM and other countries.},

abstract={The recent availability of small, cheap ultraviolet spectrometers has facilitated the rapid deployment of automated networks of scanning instruments at several volcanoes, measuring volcanic SO2 gas flux at high frequency. These networks open up a range of other applications, including tomographic reconstruction of the gas distribution which is of potential use for both risk mitigation, particularly to air traffic, and environmental impact modelling. Here we present a methodology for visualising reconstructed plumes using virtual globes, such as Google Earth, which allows animations of the evolution of the gas plume to be displayed and easily shared on a common platform. We detail the process used to convert tomographically reconstructed cross-sections into animated gas plume models, describe how this process is automated and present results from the scanning network around Mt. Etna, Sicily. We achieved an average rate of one frame every 12 min, providing a good visual representation of the plume which can be examined from all angles. In creating these models, an approximation to turbulent diffusion in the atmosphere was required. To this end we derived the value of the turbulent diffusion coefficient for quiescent conditions near Etna to be around 200-500 m2 s- 1. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Presumed obligate carriers (POCs) are the first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia who, although do not exhibit the disorder, are in direct lineage of it. Thus, this subpopulation of first-degree relatives could provide very important information with regard to the investigation of endophenotypes for schizophrenia that could clarify the often contradictory findings in schizophrenia high-risk populations. To date, despite the extant literature on schizophrenia endophenotypes, we are only aware of one other study that examined the neural mechanisms that underlie cognitive abnormalities in this group. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a more homogeneous group of relatives, such as POCs, have neural abnormalities that may be related to schizophrenia. Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to collect blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) response data in six POCs and eight unrelated healthy controls while performing under conditions of sustained, selective and divided attention. Results: The POCs indicated alterations in a widely distributed network of regions involved in attention processes, such as the prefrontal and temporal (including the parahippocampal gyrus) cortices, in addition to the anterior cingulate gyrus. More specifically, a general reduction in BOLD response was found in these areas compared to the healthy participants during attention processes. Conclusion: These preliminary findings of decreased activity in POCs indicate that this more homogeneous population of unaffected relatives share similar neural abnormalities with people with schizophrenia, suggesting that reduced BOLD activity in the attention network may be an intermediate marker for schizophrenia. © 2008 Filbey et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into the electric energy system has become an important challenge for the utilization and control of electric power systems, because of the fluctuating and intermittent behaviour of wind and solar power generation. The reliable operation of future energy supply structures with high share of distributed generation and renewable energy sources is an important and highly complex task. Supply of energy always means to find an optimal mixture of different sources. The main issues are economic effectiveness, environmental sustainability and reliability in supply. Any energy source has its own advantages and disadvantages. Over the last years the structures of electrical power supply changed noticeable. Centralistic conventional power generation is supplemented by distributed renewable energy resources. It is obvious that Germany will only meet the ambitious greenhouse gas-reduction targets - with phasing out nuclear energy at the same time - by a major increase in renewable energy usage. The pooling of large on- and offshore wind farms into clusters in the GW range will make new options feasible for an optimized integration of wind power. For this purpose, a new structure, the wind farm cluster will be introduced. All wind farms, which are directly or indirectly connected to one transmission network node, will be associated to one wind farm cluster. Major arguments against a massive penetration of RES are the intermittent generation, the poor predictability and the missing controllability. These arguments are disproved by adapting a virtual power plant (VPP) the Renewable Combi-Plant (RCP) which aggregates and controls large wind farms, PV plants, biogas fired CHP and pumped-storage hydro power plants making use of powerful RES prediction tools. Wind farm clusters are major members of the Renewable Combi-Plant, a VPP which aggregates and controls RES to face the demand at any time. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador is one of the smallest Canadian provincial capitals. Like other Canadian coastal communities, St. John's has been affected by dramatic economic and institutional restructuring that negatively impacted community health. Marginalized populations including people who inject drugs are more negatively affected by the gap between health needs and available services. Methods: A mixed methods needs assessment began with a survey and key informant and focus group interviews to determine attitudes, knowledge, and practices of people with current or previous experience injecting drugs. An environmental scan of programmes and services was conducted followed by a community consultation with key stakeholders, community agencies, study participants, the media, and members of the public to share and validate findings, solicit feedback, and gather data about future knowledge transfer activities. Results: This paper examines two of the five barriers to health and health services for people injecting drugs: First, there was a discrepancy amongst people injecting drugs between awareness and use of safer practices, and second, there was a limited formalized network of health and social programmes and services. Conclusion: Accurate and timely information about safer practices, whilst an essential component of a harm reduction approach, is insufficient to reduce the risk of negative health outcomes for people injecting drugs. Funding new programmes and services, although desirable, is not always feasible in small urban centres with limited human and material resources. Recommendations for promoting health, reducing harm, and building local capacity must consider these limitations. Registered nurses are well positioned to provide leadership through collaborative community-based research, education and advocacy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We address document image classification by visual appearance. An image is represented by a variable-length list of visually salient features. A hierarchical Bayesian network is used to model the joint density of these features. This model promotes generalization from a few samples by sharing component probability distributions among different categories, and by factoring out a common displacement vector shared by all features within an image. The Bayesian network is implemented as a factor graph, and parameter estimation and inference are both done by loopy belief propagation. We explain and illustrate our model on a simple shape classification task. We obtain close to 90% accuracy on classifying journal articles from memos in the UWASH-II dataset, as well as on other classification tasks on a home-grown data set of technical articles.},

abstract={A primary purpose in measuring safety is to develop intervention strategies to avoid future accidents. Recognizing signals before an accident occurs offers the potential for improving safety, and many organizations have sought to develop programs to identify and benefit from alerts, signals and prior indicators. In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying and evaluating leading indicators of safety in virtual organizations-organizations comprised of multiple, distributed members, temporarily linked together for competitive advantage, that share common value chains and business processes supported by distributed information technology. We begin by discussing risk propensity in virtual organizations and leading indicators of safety. We then describe a pilot study to identify leading indicators for one safety-critical system, and use the results of that study and the literature just described to propose an approach to developing leading indicators in virtual organizations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={There has been considerable debate about the apparent irrationality of end users in choosing with whom to share information, with much of the discourse crystallized in research on phishing. Designs for security technology in general, anti-spam technology, and anti-phishing technology has been targeted on specific problems with distinct methods of mitigation. In contrasts, studies of human risk behaviors argue that such specific targets for specific problems are unlikely to provide a significant increase in user trust of the internet, as humans lump and generalize. We initially theorized that communications to users need to be less specific to technical failures and more deeply embedded in social or moral terms. Our experiments indicate that users respond more strongly to a privacy policy failure than an arguably more risky technical failure. From this and previous work we conclude that design for security and privacy needs to be more expansive in that there should be more bundling of signals and products, rather than more delineation of problems into those solvable by discrete tools. Usability must be more than the interface design, but rather integrate security and privacy into a trust interaction.},

abstract={If Wi-Fi, as defined by IEEE 802.11i, can be secured, the economic advantages for electric utility operations are significant. Wi-Fi is the industry standard for IEEE 802.11 compliant products and we know that Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wireless Protected Access (WAP) systems are not secure. IEEE 802.11i defines how Wi-Fi systems work and it defines a new type of wireless network called a Robust Security Network (RSN) and Transitional Security Network (TSN) - RSN and WEP systems can operate in parallel. WPA and RSN share a common architecture and approach. This paper summarizes the work-in-progress of CIGRE B5.22 by describing both the survey of applications using Wi-Fi in protection and automation schemes, and the mitigation of security vulnerabilities offered by IEEE 802.11i on system reliability and performance. Design requirements and security levels needed for Wi-Fi protected access are prioritized in terms of their mitigation of risk related to critical mission protection and automation functions. Specific mechanisms needed to adequately implement Wi-Fi are identified and relate to existing or emerging standards. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper addresses the evolving requirements for factory integration and automation solutions that are being targeted to address the scale and complexity of the factories of the future. These requirements drive the need for real breakthrough solutions. More than ever before, there must be a strong focus on developing integrated solutions, using mainstream computer communications standards and protocols, so that development and implementation time is minimized and the software solutions are extendible as information technology evolves over time. The volume of manufacturing, process, yield, inspection, quality, and other critical data continues to exponentially increase with each new technology; therefore, its collection, storage, access, sharing, analysis, and retention methods have become a major challenge as well as a strategic competitive advantage for each company. Developing a flexible information systems architecture, with security features taking center stage to thwart possible virus infections, has also become an absolute necessity. Reduction of factory cycle times has become an important priority, as increased inventory (due to larger wafers) of the "wrong" products in an everchanging marketplace results in a high risk of product obsolescence and loss of revenue. Other equally important business drivers facing the new generation of fabs also will be covered in this article. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={In many European countries, the requirements for connections to the transmission system are implicitly based on the inherent characteristic of synchronous generating plants. With the Council Decision 2002/358/EC of 25 April 2002 the European Union signed the Kyoto Protocol and agreed on an overall 8 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels by the year 2012. This target has at the same time been fixed for every member state of the European Union. In the White Paper "Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy" the European Commission laid down the target to increase the share of renewable energies from 6 to 12 per cent by 2010. The production of electricity from renewable sources should be increased from 14,3 to 23,5 per cent by 2010. The White Paper also set a target for the production of electricity from wind power which should be increased to 40.000 MW also by 2010. In this scenario with a growing penetration of wind power and the use of DC inter-connectors, system operation may be at risk under certain conditions if changes to the existing power grid codes are not implemented. Power grid codes set in particular the requirements to fulfil for users of the transmission and distribution system. Such codes evolve to suit conventional generation, but substantial modifications are required to apply them to new forms of generation, particularly wind power. New power grid code requirements need to be constantly updated in compliance with new technology developments in order to allow an easier access to the transmission system for unconventional forms of generation, yet ensuring system security and reliability. Such modifications have been already done or are in the process of being developed, by many European countries in order to accommodate the massive wind power development. The purpose of this paper is to explain the new grid code requirements and assess their implications. An overview of interconnection requirements to a transmission system and a comparison among a group of European countries is given (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway). The countries chosen for such purpose are representative either for their experience in large scale wind power integration or for their interconnection to Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE).},

This potentially exposes the data to heightened security risks. In particular, the activity on a database exhibits regular page reference patterns that could help attackers learn logical links among physical pages and then launch additional attacks. We propose two countermeasures to mitigate the risk of attacks initiated through analyzing the shared storage server's activity for those page patterns. The first countermeasure relocates data pages according to which page sequences they are in. The second countermeasure enhances the first by randomly prefetching pages from predicted page sequences. We have implemented the two countermeasures in MySQL, and experiment results demonstrate their effectiveness and practicality. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={It is observed that the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) transformation based on min-plus algebra (or called Tropical Semi-Rings) leads to a very good characteristic in zero underestimating the reconstructed matrix. This paper introduces a novel distributed control framework for shared protection in optical networks with reduced routing information based on the Tropical Semi-Rings technique, called Sharing with Reduced Information with Tropical Semi-Rings (SRI-TROP). The design of the proposed framework aims to initiate a compromise between the amount of link-state dissemination and the performance impairment due to the incompleteness of routing information, such that the precision in the link-state matrix reconstruction can efficiently map to the reduction in blocking probability. Based on the framework, a series of novel schemes are proposed, which are verified and compared with the reported counterparts in a simulation. The simulation results show that the performance in terms of the precision in the reconstructed link-state and the resultant blocking probability can be significantly improved. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Since 9/11, hospitals and health authorities have been preparing medical response in case of various mass terror attacks. The experience of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in treating suicide-bombing mass casualties served, in the time leading up to the war in Iraq, as a platform for launching a preparedness program for possible attacks with biological and chemical agents of mass destruction. Adapting Quarantelli's criteria on disaster mitigation to the "microinfrastructure" of the hospital, and including human behavior experts, we attempted to foster an interactive emergency management process that would deal with contingencies stemming from the potential hazards of chemical and biological (CB) weapons. The main objective of our work was to encourage an organization-wide communication network that could effectively address the contingent hazards unique to this unprecedented situation. A stratified assessment of needs, identification of unique dangers to first responders, and assignment of team-training sessions paved the way for program development. Empowerment through leadership and resilience training was introduced to emergency team leaders of all disciplines. Focal subject matters included proactive planning, problem-solving, informal horizontal and vertical communication, and coping through stress-management techniques. The outcome of this process was manifested in an "operation and people" orientation supporting a more effective and compatible emergency management. The aim of article is to describe this process and to point toward the need for a broad-spectrum view in such circumstances. Unlike military units, the civilian hospital staff at risk, expected to deal with CB casualties, requires adequate personal consideration to enable effective functioning. Issues remain to be addressed in the future. We believe that collaboration and sharing of knowledge, information, and expertise beyond the medical realm is imperative in assisting hospitals to expedite appropriate preparedness programs. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Operations has grown beyond relying only on SCADA infrastructure - can you operate without your non-scada infrastructure? As the operator of the world's longest and most complex liquids pipeline, Enbridge Pipelines Inc. relies heavily on automated systems to control, monitor, maintain our pipeline system. As the scope of automation continues to expand beyond the SCADA control system, so to does the dependence on ancillary computer applications such as pipeline scheduling, electronic ticketing, nominations and oil accounting. Uninterrupted operation of the pipeline system now depends on an increasingly complex electronic infrastructure and new levels of reliability are required from this infrastructure. This paper will describe the inherent risks as we continue to increase the automation of pipelining functions such as scheduling, oil accounting and electronic ticketing. We will discuss the type of technological threats (system failure, design flaws, security) and the strategies adopted by Enbridge for mitigating each of them. Further to the risks, this paper will explore the infrastructure components where exceptional risk mitigation is required, and the measures that Enbridge has taken to minimize the risks associated with those components. Specific areas to be analysed include; wide and local area networks, power and environmental systems, system clustering, hot and cold standby systems, network segment isolation and system backup solutions. Attention will also be paid to the increasing dependence on shared infrastructure services such as the Internet and telecommunications. For each of these technology areas, we will discuss the level of adoption within Enbridge, and the value proposition for these decisions. We will attempt to answer the questions; Why go that far? Why not go further? Finally, we will discuss the technology infrastructure requirements for business resumption. We will discuss system and site redundancy alternatives employed by Enbridge, the challenges involved in establishing business resumption plans, and how they are used by Enbridge to minimize the operational risk to our pipeline.

abstract={The worldwide commercial aviation system is a complex system involving hardware, software, and liveware (humans). All of these components must work together efficiently and effectively in a variety of environments in order for the system to function successfully. One of the least predictable aspects of how the system operates is what the humans will do. In the aviation system, much of this lack of predictability results from inadvertent error and/or operators of the system trying to optimize the functioning of the system in unanticipated situations. When undesirable consequences result from the inadvertent error and/or well-intentioned efforts to make the system work better, the human action is usually classified as "human error." As the aviation system becomes more complex, safety professionals are concluding that responding successfully to "human error" necessitates increased focus on the system. Focusing primarily upon the individual who committed the "error" (a) assumes, sometimes incorrectly, that the most effective remedy is getting the individual to behave differently, and (b) fails to consider the role of the system in leading to the undesired behavior. An essential element for enhanced system focus is better information. Rapid advances in information technologies are creating unprecedented opportunities for safety professionals to collect better information about how the operators of the system make it work. That information helps safety professionals improve the system by making it (a) less likely to result in human error, i.e., less error prone; and (b) more capable of withstanding human error without catastrophic result, i.e., more error tolerant. The Global Aviation Information Network (GAIN) is promoting and facilitating the voluntary collection, analysis, and sharing of information in the international aviation community to improve safety. GAIN was proposed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), but it has evolved into an international coalition of aviation community members - airlines, manufacturers, unions, and governments. GAIN is helping to create legal and cultural environments that encourage and facilitate the collection of large quantities of data. GAIN is also creating tools and processes to help aviation safety professionals convert that data into useful information to (a) identify potential safety issues, (b) prioritize them, (c) develop solutions, and (d) evaluate whether the solutions are working. Two aspects of GAIN that have been discovered from experience are significantly enhancing its development. First, the tools and processes can be used not only in other transportation modes, but also in other industries, including chemical manufacturing, nuclear power, public utilities, health care and national security. Second, experience is demonstrating that the systematic collection and sharing of safety information can not only facilitate the correction of troublesome trends, but can also result in significant immediate cost savings in operations and maintenance. In theory, other industries applying these tools and processes should also be able to reap significant immediate economic benefits.

abstract={Series capacitor compensation of AC transmission systems provides an economical solution for the power transmission companies to increase maximum power carrying capacity of existing transmission lines, control of load sharing of parallel lines and enhance transient stability. However, looking at it from generating utility point of view, the series compensation of lines may lead to possible Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR), in case of transient faults, of turbine generator units resulting in fatigue life reduction of turbine generator rotors and even damages which may prove to be very costly. In power stations having more than one bus connected parallel generating units, the SSR consequences depend on the number of units in parallel operation at the time of transient fault occurrence. In this paper, these consequences have been simulated for different combinations of parallel operating units for a power station having five generating units to determine the worst case combination. Simulations have been done for varying compensation ratio. Acceptable value of series compensation ratio has been determined considering worst case operating units combination and the fatigue limit of turbine generator rotor. Frequency domain analysis of electrical torque to determine the turbine generator rotor natural frequencies, frequency scanning of passive electrical network reactance viewed from a point behind the generator stator winding to determine the network natural frequencies, and finally the time domain simulation to capture the system dynamics following a transient fault have been demonstrated for different operating unit combinations. Simulation methodology demonstrated in this paper can prove to be very useful for system planning decisions related to determining SSR risks of series compensation for bus connected parallel generating units. © 2003 IEEE.},

abstract={Samuelson stated in 1967 that 'beauty about social insurance is that .... everyone who reaches retirement age is given benefit priveleges that far exceed anything he has paid in'. Such an optimistic belief seems to have been widely shared in Italy, where until the beginning of the reform process in 1992 social security could be described as a continuous succession of highly generous and diversified promises of payment made by the state to the different categories of workers on the basis of salary earned in the final stage of working life. The pension reform introduced by the Dini government in 1995 led to the adoption of a contribution-based method of calculation, which meant a return to the forgotten 'golden rule' that the financial equilibrium of pay-as-you-go sytems is ensured only if the implicit yield is equal to the rate of growth of the taxable basis of social security contributions. Equilibrium would thus be safeguarded, restoring itself automatically after any accidental disruption caused by demographic or economic upheaval, and operating regardless of the capacity and will of governments and of the majorities supporting them. The great efforts made to build up sufficient consensus with respect to such radical modifications of principle were, however, accompanied by a marked caution in bringing the system into full effect. This has left the country with the problem of accelerating transition to the new mechanism of calculating contributions, applied initially only to the newly employed and pro rata to workers with less than 18 yr of contributions paid in, thereby making for a very long period of transition. In such a connection, a recent proposal has suggested that the state should try to induce workers to agree freely to a reduction in their accrued pension entitlements through the public system in return for a share in the process of privatization. If government were to repay the pension debt 'below par', this would allow for greater savings on future expenditure by using part of the revenues of privatization to pay off the pension debt in advance rather than by using these sums to pay off the national debt. More radical approaches aiming at cutting back social spending would fail to take into account the risks involved in the collapse of public trust and of the structures that have hitherto guaranteed the cohesion of Italian society and the conditions for entrepreneurial commitment. On the other hand, an unbridled bottom-up proliferation of networks of social cohesion, supplementary voluntary bodies and non-profit initiatives may involve the risk of further arbitrary action being taken in the name of income redistribution. The social market requires bottom-up action on the part of associations, but also the guarantee of state-imposed rules that are equal for all parties and of a market that is free from the distortions of competition regulated form the top. A welfare state that has too often disguised the redistribution of resources in non-transparent forms must be replaced by a transparent welfare system effecting an explicit redistribution of resources and allowing a suitable regulated market to operate without indulging continually in further forms of 'correction'. This calls for the introduction of a microchip 'citizen card', able to offer characteristics both of uniformity and of fine-tuning in terms of specific conditions of age, income, assets, education, etc., so as to permit forms of selection and/or cost sharing where desirable. Some of the rights to welfare services incorporated in the 'citizen card' could in fact be assigned in monetary form but restricted to specific uses. Such 'social money', conveniently based on modern technological transaction structures, could become the money of the state sector, the private sector, and the third sector of non-profit organizations and associations, enabling all parties to respond to the objective demand expressed by citizens in conditions of compettion that are free of supply-side distortion.},

abstract={Health systems throughout the world are searching for better ways of responding to present and future challenges. Latin America is no exception in this innovative process. Health systems in this region have to face a dual challenge: on the one hand, they must deal with a backlog of accumulated problems characteristic of underdeveloped societies; on the other hand, they are already facing a set of emerging problems characteristic of industrialized countries. This paper aims at analyzing the performance of current health systems in Latin America, while proposing an innovative model to promote equity, quality, and efficiency. We first develop a conceptualization of health systems in terms of the relationships between populations and institutions. In order to meet population needs, health systems must perform four basic functions. Two of these-financing and delivery-are conventional functions performed by every health system. The other two have often been carried out only in an implicit way or not at all. These neglected functions are 'modulation' (a broader concept than regulation, which involves setting transparent and fair rules of the game) and 'articulation' (which makes it possible to organize and manage a series of transactions among members of the population, financing agencies, and providers so that resources can flow into the production and consumption of services). Based on this conceptual framework, the paper offers a classification of current health system models in Latin America. The most frequent one, the segmented model, is criticized because it segregates the different social groups into three segments: the ministry of health, the social security institute(s), and the private sector. Each of these is vertically integrated, so that it performs all functions but only for a particular group. As an alternative, we propose a model of 'structured pluralism', which would turn the current system around by organizing it according to functions rather than social groups. In this model, modulation would become the central mission of the ministry of health, which would move out of the direct provision of personal health services. Financing would be the main function of social security institutes, which would be gradually extended to protect the entire population. The articulation function would be made explicit by fostering the establishment of 'organizations for health services articulation', which would perform a series of crucial activities, including the competitive enrollment of populations into health plans in exchange for a risk-adjusted capitation, the specification of explicit packages of benefits or interventions, the organization of networks of providers so as to structure consumer choices, the design and implementation of incentives to providers through payment mechanisms, and the management of quality of care. Finally, the delivery function would be open to pluralism that would be adapted to differential needs of urban and rural populations. After examining the convergence of various reform initiatives towards elements of the structured pluralism model, the paper reviews both the technical instruments and the political strategies for implementing changes. The worldwide health reform movement needs to sustain a systematic sharing of the unique learning opportunity that each reform experience represents.},
