abstract={There is no doubt that Cloud Computing (CC) introduces opportunities that mobilize new strategic ICT agenda across organizations. Like the Internet when it was first introduced, the introduction of Cloud Computing unveils the creation of enormous possibilities in information sharing. Unlike the Internet, Cloud Computing allows organizations to transfer ICT assets externally to meet their cost reduction agenda in predefined contractual terms. However, both the Internet and Cloud Computing only highlight security challenges, prevalent undoubtedly, especially at the time when the popularity of Cloud Computing continues to mount. In this article, common security threats to Cloud Computing are explored. These threats are addressed through acceptable measures, through governance and effective risk management using a tailored Security Risk Approach (SRA).},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoTs) is an emerging technological paradigm that entails interconnected smart objects in order to sense, communicate and interact autonomously, finally providing advanced services. This innovative phenomenon makes the smart objects capable of seeing, hearing, thinking and performing jobs by sharing information and coordinating decisions. The potential growth of IoTs is highly dependent upon enabling technologies like RFID technology, Sensor technology, smart technologies and nanotechnology. RFID is the first communication technology that apprehends the concept of M2M, enabling the machines to identify objects, understanding their status, communicating information and taking necessary actions. In this paper we highlight important security and privacy risks/issues, challenges and countermeasures involved in the mobile RFID when it is used in IoTs.

abstract={In the world, the territorial risk is increasingly characterized by joint presence of multiple risks, both natural and anthropogenic. Natural hazards include: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods, landslides, coastal erosion, subsidence, water shortages and avalanches. The major anthropic risks are: terrorism, CBRN risk, big event and urban crisis, the industrial-technological risk, the interface and forest fire risk, the environmental risk and also health risk. Today, the modern society are formed by a great complexity of networks and systems. Continuous supply of essential services (i.e. electricity, transport, health care, emergency, banking and financial system) is increasingly a fundamental and concrete need. In all industrialized countries, this complexity has been shown to have a significant effects on the welfare of citizens, social organization, economy and territorial security. In fact, a partial or total detriment of the networks and systems' capacity can have a debilitating impact on society, on defense and security both locally and nationally for the Domino effect. Obviously, if the cities are densely populated this problem is amplified. Finally, the interdependence between networks and urban system is made possible by the rapid growth and integration of infrastructure and telecommunications. If this has improved the lives of citizens, has also made the entire system more delicate and vulnerable. To mitigate this risk profile and optimizing the prevention and mitigation actions and to counteract the consequences of such events, there are some key elements: i) monitoring and control of infrastructures and territory, ii) the adoption of appropriate emergency and contingency plans, iii) the increasing the resilience, iv) the implementation of security policies for public/private partnership but overall, v) the proper management of information. This is important to achieve a holistic, integrated, comprehensive and multidimensional approach during crisis or emergencies. To achieve this new way to deal with the crisis/emergency event, we must take both a technological and organizational change and evolution of the general architecture of the system. So we can built an homogenous and collaborative environment that allow us to create an institutional, geographical, technical and operational connectivity and the concretization of a rational, consistent and interoperable response. Therefore, we need to built a integrated chain of acquisition, organization and management of data and information coming from the entire territory passing through the use of an integration strategy among space, airborne and ground data acquisition systems. In this way, we can achieve a high level of detail. This is allowed because the data, the information and images of the event, may not only be manipulated, analyzed and displayed, but also converted and used as data input to system such as Geographic Information System (GIS) and Common Operational Picture (COP). So, the decision makers can get an overview of operational framework of the event and may also share this vision with different institutions, structures and organizations. They can be supported in the characterization and management of crisis or emergency and also in collaborative planning.},

abstract={In this paper we examine the interdependencies and common points of failure (and attack) that plague commonly-used system and network hardware and software. The proposed approach requires not only generating inventories of acquiring organizations' equipment and software products, and clear and detailed descriptions of every link in the supply chain, but also the identification of common components and their sources. This information is required not only for manufacturer and OEM supply chains, but also for the services supply chains of maintenance and repair organizations. When such critical components and services have been identified, one must prioritize their importance and apply appropriate security and testing. Such an identification and tracking system is only as good as its ability to incorporate up-to-the-minute changes and additions. This requires extensive real-time reporting and information sharing. The author presents a general description of a proprietary tool that facilitates the collaboration needed for such an approach to be effective.},

abstract={To provide a comprehensive security analysis of modern networked systems, we need to take into account the combined effects of existing vulnerabilities and zero-day vulnerabilities. In addition to them, it is important to incorporate new vulnerabilities emerging from threats such as BYOD, USB file sharing. Consequently, there may be new dependencies between system components that could also create new attack paths, but previous work did not take into account those new attack paths in their security analysis (i.e., not all attack paths are taken into account). Thus, countermeasures may not be effective, especially against attacks exploiting the new attack paths. In this paper, we propose a Unified Vulnerability Risk Analysis Module (UV-RAM) to address the aforementioned problems by taking into account the combined effects of those vulnerabilities and capturing the new attack paths. The three main functionalities of UV-RAM are: (i) to discover new dependencies and new attack paths, (ii) to incorporate new vulnerabilities introduced and zero-day vulnerabilities into security analysis, and (iii) to formulate mitigation strategies for hardening the networked system. Our experimental results demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of UV-RAM.},

abstract={As network attacks have increased in number and severity over the past few years, intrusion detection system (IDS) is increasingly becoming a critical component to secure the network. Due to large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviors, optimizing performance of IDS becomes an important open problem that is receiving more and more attention from the research community. Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. The human labeling of the available network audit data instances is usually tedious, time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called k-means clustering via naïve bayes classification for anomaly based network intrusion detection. Experimental results on the KDD cup'99 data set show the novelty of our approach in detecting network intrusion. It is observed that the proposed technique performs better in terms of Detection rate when applied to KDD'99 data sets compared to a naïve bayes based approach.},

abstract={The rapidly shrinking size of processor chips and memory, coupled with increasing speed and processing elements, has enabled widespread usage of embedded systems running software code, for the overall control and monitoring of larger systems. These embedded systems have proliferated in almost all the modern electronic equipment used in industries, home, automobiles, military battlefields, space or personal consumer electronic systems. The omnipresent and pervasive computing enabled by these embedded systems controlling/monitoring a wide array of complex networked or independent systems, need to be dependable and safe. With mass proliferation, the security of embedded systems presents a unique set of requirements and challenges. It is therefore important to study and assess the potential risks, threat vectors, potential adversaries/attackers and attack methodologies in order to effectively incorporate security in technology and processes right from the conceptual/design stages. The identification and analysis of the threats, vulnerabilities and study of risk mitigation methods, potential attackers and common attack methodologies is critical in implementing security measures in design, development, exploitation and final disposal phases of the embedded system.},

pages={896-899},
abstract={In the lower echelon tactical environment, Situational Awareness (SA) information must be passed up the chain of command from squad-level infantry to platoon networks. The challenge is that the squad-level infantry networks typically operate at lower classification levels than the platoon command and control (C2) networks, which need information sent from below. A wearable one-way transfer (WOWT) device allows formatted position location information (PLI) to flow from an unclassified tactical radio network up to a classified C2 network. This device is designed to be worn by the squad or platoon leaders so the PLI data received from their troops can be transmitted via their classified radio to the C2 network. The MITRE team analyzed applicable information assurance (IA) policies and technical issues to create an affordable, Small Form Factor approach to move data from an unclassified radio network directly to a classified radio network without placing the secure network at risk. Recent MITRE work has focused on the evaluation of commercial technology for application to the dismounted soldier. This work includes the prototyping and testing of affordable ultra high frequency (UHF) radio networks capable of providing Type III secure voice and SA data to the members of a dismounted infantry squad, such as a WOWT device to forward the squad-level SA up (one way only) to a classified platoon radio network. MITRE analyzed applicable IA policies and technical issues to create an affordable approach to move data from an unclassified radio network directly to a classified radio network without putting the secure network at risk. This approach meets the full intent of IA policies and requirements, but at lower size, power, and cost than cross domain solutions (CDSs). We believe this device has immediate application to both the Army and Marine Corps, which have already fielded commercial APCO 25 radios for secure unclassified voice applications. Fielding an interim WOWT device will leverage the investments already made in these UHF APCO 25 radios and serve as an interim gap-filler until the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), the Ground Soldier System (GSS) networks, and the CDSs become available. It will also provide an architecture capable of feeding Secret platoon SA with unclassified squad-level SA. Finally, it will provide dismounted forces the opportunity to experiment with this new capability years before the Programs of Record will become available.},

abstract={Humanitarian aid workers who try to provide aid to the most vulnerable populations in the Middle East or Africa are risking their own lives and safety to help others. The current lack of a collaborative real-time information system to predict threats prevents responders and local partners from developing a shared understanding of potentially threatening situations, causing increased response times and leading to inadequate protection. To solve this problem, this paper presents a threat detection and decision support system that combines knowledge and information from a network of responders with automated and modular threat detection. The system consists of three parts. It first collects textual information, ranging from social media, and online news reports to reports and text messages from a decentralized network of humanitarian staff. Second, the system uses deep neural network techniques to automatically detects a threat or incident and provide information including location, threat category, and casualties. Third, given the type of threat and the information extracted by the NER, a feedforward network proposes a mitigation plan based on humanitarian standard operating procedures. The classified information is rapidly redistributed to potentially affected humanitarian workers at any level. The system testing results show a high precision of 0.91 and 0.98 as well as an F-measure of 0.87 and 0.88 in detecting the threats and decision support respectively. We thus combine the collaborative intelligence of a decentralized network of aid workers with the power of deep neural networks.},

abstract={Natural disasters always result in large scale financial, environmental and human asset losses. In these crises there is the possibility of damage to significant parts of the communication systems of cities and/or countries. Consequently critical information and communication systems might become unavailable. In such cases an emergency ad-hoc communication network could be established between different emergency service organisations (police, fire services, medical support etc.) to share critical information in order to control the situation. During crisis management operational activities, emergency service personnel (police, paramedic or fire service personnel) and their equipment are at high risk of damage from physical circumstances and events. Any harm to emergency service personnel or their equipment could result in communication link failures, loss of sensitive data and many other threats which could result in various critical issues, such as data unavailability, information delay and internal and external attacks. The safety of emergency service personnel and their communication devices is critically important to ensure that the services remain fully operational. In this paper we propose an architecture using a body area sensor network to protect assets (emergency service personnel, equipment and data inside the network) from damage and attacks, and to take appropriate actions to mitigate risks.},

abstract={This paper provides a thorough study on shared segment protection (SSP) for mesh communication networks in the complete routing information scenario, where the integer linear program (ILP) in [1] is extended such that the following two constraints are well addressed: (a) The restoration time constraint for each connection request, and (b) the switching/merging capacity constraint at each node. A novel approach, called SSP algorithm, is developed to reduce the extremely high computation complexity in solving the ILP formulation. Basically, our approach is to derive a good approximation on the parameters in the ILP by referring to the result of solving the corresponding shared path protection (SPP) problem. Thus, the design space can be significantly reduced by eliminating some edges in the graphs. We will show in the simulation that with our approach, the optimality can be achieved in most of the cases. To verify the proposed formulation and investigate the performance impairment in terms of average cost and success rate by the additional two constraints, extensive simulation work has been conducted on three network topologies, in which SPP and shared link protection (SLP) are implemented for comparison. We will demonstrate that the proposed SSP algorithm can effectively and efficiently solve the survivable routing problem with constraints on restoration time and switching/merging capability of each node. The comparison among the three protection types further verifies that SSP can yield significant advantages over SPP and SLP without taking much computation time.},

abstract={Information and communication technologies have augmented interoperability and rapidly advanced varying industries, with vast complex interconnected networks being formed in areas such as safety-critical systems, which can be further categorised as critical infrastructures. What also must be considered is the paradigm of the Internet of Things which is rapidly gaining prevalence within the field of wireless communications, being incorporated into areas such as e-health and automation for industrial manufacturing. As critical infrastructures and the Internet of Things begin to integrate into much wider networks, their reliance upon communication assets by third parties to ensure collaboration and control of their systems will significantly increase, along with system complexity and the requirement for improved security metrics. We present a critical analysis of the risk assessment methods developed for generating attack graphs. The failings of these existing schemas include the inability to accurately identify the relationships and interdependencies between the risks and the reduction of attack graph size and generation complexity. Many existing methods also fail due to the heavy reliance upon the input, identification of vulnerabilities, and analysis of results by human intervention. Conveying our work, we outline our approach to modelling interdependencies within large heterogeneous collaborative infrastructures, proposing a distributed schema which utilises network modelling and attack graph generation methods, to provide a means for vulnerabilities, exploits and conditions to be represented within a unified model.},

abstract={Preserving online privacy is becoming increasingly challenging due in large part to the continued growth of social media. Those who choose to share their information publicly may not realize what features of their profiles make their public data more identifiable and potentially vulnerable to cross-site record linkage. This paper proposes a risk reduction recommendation method that suggests removal or modification of a small number of attributes to make a profile less unique, thereby reducing the identifiability and vulnerability of the user. Empirical results on data collected from Google+, LinkedIn, and Foursquare show that users' vulnerability in terms of identifiability and data exposure level can be significantly reduced while public profile utility can be maintained using our proposed approach.},

abstract={With the escalation in security breaches on organizations and institutions that store, maintain and work with critical data, there is a need for a security-enhancing and risk-mitigating solution that works on the fly and is feasible to implement. Software Defined Networks is a networking paradigm that makes the network agile by disaggregating hardware and software. SDN helps enhance security with the help of micro-segmentation. The controller maintains a central view of the network, and its ability to monitor and store network information helps optimize routing. The centralization nature of the controller makes it vulnerable to DoS attacks which can be catastrophic for network functioning. The objective of this paper is to secure the distributed SDN controller architecture against DoS attacks. The proposed architecture is robust, scalable, and uses Big Data techniques to process streams of network traffic in real-time and Machine Learning to detect and mitigate DoS attacks.},

abstract={The introduction of Internet of Things has attracted increasing number of security risks to the smart home due to the continual exposure of devices to remote network. As a last line of defence, security guidelines are issued to the user to supplement network and manufacturer level risk mitigation efforts. While these guidelines address specific security issues, they are varied and lacking in structure for common representation, understanding and sharing among the smart home community (vendors, developers and household). The smart home user as the executor of these guidelines is faced with additional responsibility that can make the smart home management a daunting task. In this work, an ontology is proposed to represent knowledge about the security guidelines for interoperability and understanding among the smart home actors. Further to this, a context-based ontology is developed, which adapts to changing contextual information like user context and physical context. We highlight different use cases of security guidelines and discuss how the context-based ontology can help the user perform these guidelines automatically.},

In this paper, we present ACCUSE (Android Confidentiality Concern User Support Environment),an approach aimed at helping Android users and developers to compare and contrast the risk level of a set of Android apps. First, ACCUSE assigns to each app risk factors based on the Android classification of permissions. Then, such factors are combined with the app rating and downloading information to produce a new, overall risk factor. ACCUSE has been evaluated on a realworld dataset of 11,576 android apps as well as on a baseline of around 1000 known malware apps. Our results show that ACCUSE always assigns high risk to known malware apps, and outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={Privacy and information security in general are major concerns that impede enterprise adaptation of shared or public cloud computing. Specifically, the concern of virtual machine (VM) physical co-residency stems from the threat that hostile tenants can leverage various forms of side channels (such as cache covert channels) to exfiltrate sensitive information of victims on the same physical system. However, on virtualized x86 systems, covert channel attacks have not yet proven to be practical, and thus the threat is widely considered a “potential risk.” In this paper, we present a novel covert channel attack that is capable of high-bandwidth and reliable data transmission in the cloud. We first study the application of existing cache channel techniques in a virtualized environment and uncover their major insufficiency and difficulties. We then overcome these obstacles by: (1) redesigning a pure timing-based data transmission scheme, and (2) exploiting the memory bus as a high-bandwidth covert channel medium. We further design and implement a robust communication protocol and demonstrate realistic covert channel attacks on various virtualized x86 systems. Our experimental results show that covert channels do pose serious threats to information security in the cloud. Finally, we discuss our insights on covert channel mitigation in virtualized environments.},

abstract={Online Social Network provides a simple and easier way to connect with our friends and relatives to share daily activities and event of our day to day life. Most of us cannot live without social network. But just like other online activity, even social networks are having lot of security threats to its users. Most of Research on Social Network reveals that Social Network are the primary sources for getting confidential information of the victim so that they can do numerous fraudulent activities like cyber bullying, money laundering, spreading fake or false messages to create panic situation in public or to fool other user. They already have set their target on social networking website to do their fraudulent activities. Fraudsters are always trying to find any loopholes in the existing system so that they can get access to the system to launch various social engineering attack and scam activities. The security and privacy on these networks has been increasing as the amount of personal information posted by millions of users in their profile is made public. A social networking site allows millions of users to communicate online and large amount of information has been posted daily. So in every few seconds a large amount of data has been generated around the world. This necessitates the adaptation of new methodology to provide security of online data. Social network users are not aware of the various security threats and the associated risks exist in these networks. This paper presents an assessment of classification different social network and different attacks present on those social networks and methodology has been proposed which help the online users to be safe from numerous fraudulent and malicious activities on the web.},

pages={111-116},
abstract={Social relationships defined by phone calls made between people can be grouped into various relationship types or categories, such as family members, co-workers, etc. We propose and evaluate a method that predicts the "relationship type" between a pair of mobile phone subscribers using features that abstract their communication behavior and social network patterns. Our dataset consists of call detail records of a major wireless carrier sampled from four demographically diverse regions, from which we built a directed social graph, with over 200,000 vertices and 400,000 edges. Using account and subscription plan information, we labeled each edge in the graph as one of the following four relationships: family, co-worker, customer and service. Our analysis of the dataset shows that these four relationship types exhibit distinct communication behavior patterns and generate characteristic topological features on the social network surrounding the pairs. For instance, subscriber pairs with a family relationship generate high average number of calls, have low call duration, call more frequently and share more mutual contacts than pairs with a service or co-worker relationship. Using a set of features that abstract these characteristics and the Random Forest supervised machine learning classifier, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the relationship type between a subscriber pair with an accuracy of 87%.},

abstract={Computer network is expanding day by day and number of users are increasing on the network. There are many attacks on the network with makes user on risk, leading to security of their data. Attackers are using novel method for getting information of users. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to detect such attack done on the network by monitoring the network traffic. In general attacks are of four types on the network in which Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Prob attacks are of majority categories (generally found or common), User-to-Root (U2R) and Remote-to-Login (R2L) are of minority categories (rarely found or rare). The rare attacks are very harmful for a host. The present day systems are not able to effectively detect such attacks. In this approach, a model is proposed of two layers to improve the detection rate of minority attacks. Feature selection for minor attacks is done using statistical analysis and a multi classifier artificial neural network is trained with a separate data set to improve the rate of detection of the minority attacks. The accuracy of 99.34 % is recorded for minor attacks detection.},

abstract={Network slicing is a key enabling technology to realize the provisioning of customized services in 5G paradigm. Due to logical isolation instead of physical isolation, network slicing is facing a series of security issues. Side Channel Attack (SCA) is a typical attack for slices that share resources in the same hardware. Considering the risk of SCA among slices, this paper investigates how to effectively allocate heterogeneous resources for the slices under their different security requirements. Then, a SCA-aware Resource Allocation (SCA-RA) algorithm is proposed for Ultra-reliable and Low-latency Communications (URLLC) and Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) slices in 5G RAN. The objective is to maximize the number of slices accommodated in 5G RAN. With dynamic slice requests, simulation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in two different network scenarios. Simulation results indicate that compared with benchmark, SCA-RA algorithm can effectively reduce blocking probability of slice requests. In addition, the usage of IT and transport resources is also optimized.},

abstract={In any situation where a set of personal attributes are revealed, there is a chance that revealed data can be linked back to its owner. Examples of such situations are publishing user profile micro-data or information about social ties, sharing profile information on social networking sites, or revealing personal information in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Measuring user anonymity is the first step to ensuring that the identity of the owner of revealed information cannot be inferred. Most current measures of anonymity ignore important factors such as the probabilistic nature of identity inference, the inferrer's outside knowledge, and the correlation between user attributes. Furthermore, in the social computing domain, variations in personal information and various levels of information exchange among users make the problem more complicated. We present an information-entropy-based realistic estimation of the user anonymity level to deal with these issues in social computing in an effort to help predict the identity inference risks. We then address implementation issues of online protection by proposing complexity reduction methods that take advantage of basic information entropy properties. Our analysis and delay estimation based on experimental data show that our methods are viable, effective, and efficient in facilitating privacy in social computing and synchronous CMCs.},

abstract={End-to-end key exchange for the subsequent secret sharing and secure communication between two remote parties has been an important issue due to the threats of eavesdropping and Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure end-to-end key exchange mechanism between two remote parties by cooperation of multiple devices at each party using QR (Quick Response) codes. In the key exchange process, the data transmission will be conducted by two different applications via two different infrastructure networks, SMS (Short Message Service) via cellular network (e.g. LTE, 4G, etc) and Email via Ethernet respectively, between the two remote parties using two different devices at each party in order to mitigate security risks. Public-key cryptography will be adopted for the data transmission during the key exchange and the corresponding asymmetric key pair will be used only once. The data transmission within the multiple devices at each party only uses QR codes (scan and display) without involving any network based communication. The main contribution of this paper is that a novel secure end-to-end key exchange approach has been proposed in which unless both the devices using cellular network and Ethernet have been compromised or MITM attacked by the same attacker the key will not be leaked during the exchange process. We verified the main features of the proposed mechanism and confirmed the effectiveness of the design.},

abstract={If Wi-Fi, as defined by IEEE 802.11i, can be secured, the economic advantages for electric utility operations are significant. Wi-Fi is the industry standard for IEEE 802.11 compliant products and we know that wired equivalent privacy (WEP) and wireless protected access (WAP) systems are not secure. IEEE 802.11i defines how Wi-Fi systems work and it defines a new type of wireless network called a robust security network (RSN) and transitional security network (TSN)-RSN and WEP systems can operate in parallel.

abstract={Due to the limited transmission capability of mobile nodes in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), the intermediate nodes are used in multi-hop fashion for forwarding the packets for other nodes. However, the multi-hop communication causes a serious problem that a node may act as selfish by refraining from forwarding the packets for other nodes in order to save its energy and computing resources. A selfish node attempts to utilize the network resources for its own benefits, but reluctant to spend its resources for others. Therefore, it is really important to scrutinize and isolate the selfish nodes from the network in order to trim down the risks from such nodes, and improve the security of the network. This paper presents a comparative study of most prominent selfish node detection and mitigation techniques proposed by the researchers in the literature.},

abstract={Social media has a significant impact on our daily life, and the popularity is increasing rapidly because of the ability to be attached to people around the world and share feelings, photos, videos, etc. So, it bears a high-security concern. However, most of the social media user does not know the security level of their account, including what features of social media should consider if the account is in a risk situation. The posting, friendship, etc. sometimes brings unfortunate events like identity theft, sexual harassment, cyber-crime, etc. To overcome such kind of unexpected issues, this research proposes a classification via clustering algorithm based predictive model by which one can know his safety level in the social media. A dataset is formed through a closed-ended questionnaire. Essential features are selected via gain ration method as high dimensional data is costly to train a model. An unsupervised algorithm, hierarchical clustering, cluster the users into three groups that are labeled for further analysis. The various classification algorithm is chosen to train the predictive model. From the model evaluation result, “Logistic Regression” predicts the safety level of a social media user with high accuracy. So, this model will bring an extra dimension in social media user account safety.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a secure incentive scheme to achieve fair and reliable cooperative (SIRC) downloading in highway vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). SIRC can stimulate vehicle users to help download-and-forward packets for each other and consists of cooperative downloading and forwarding phase. During the cooperative downloading phase, SIRC utilizes “virtual checks” associated with the designated verifier signature to ensure fair and secure cooperation. Meanwhile, to minimize the payment risk of the client vehicle, partial prepayment strategy is adopted, i.e., the vehicles involved in downloading packets can only obtain part of the check before the client vehicle confirms the packet reception. During the cooperative forwarding phase, a profit-sharing model associated with an aggregating Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signature can stimulate cooperation and reduce the authentication overhead. In addition, we develop a reputation system to encourage cooperation and punish malicious vehicles. The aggregating CL signature and the symmetric cryptosystem are applied to resist various attacks, including injection/removing attack, free riding attack, submission refusal attack, and denial of service attacks. Extensive simulation results are given to show that the proposed SIRC can achieve a high download success rate and low average download delay with moderate cryptographic computation and communication overhead.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed many application domains with realtime, continuous, automated control and information transmission. The smart grid is one such futuristic application domain in execution, with a large-scale IoT network as its backbone. By leveraging the functionalities and characteristics of IoT, the smart grid infrastructure benefits not only consumers, but also service providers and power generation organizations. The confluence of IoT and smart grid comes with its own set of challenges. The underlying cyberspace of IoT, though facilitates communication (information propagation) among devices of smart grid infrastructure, it undermines the privacy at the same time. In this paper we propose a new measure for quantifying the probability of privacy leakage based on the behaviors of the devices involved in the communication process. We construct a privacy stochastic game model based on the information shared by the device, and the access to the compromised device. The existence of Nash Equilibrium strategy of the game is proved theoretically. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the privacy stochastic game model.},

abstract={Due to the openness of online social networks (OSNs), they have become the most popular platforms for people to communicate with others in the expectation of sharing their opinions in a trustworthy environment. However, individuals are often exposed to a wide range of risks posed by malicious users who spread various fake information to achieve their vicious goals, which makes the concept of trust a vital issue. Most of the existing research attempts to construct a trust network among users, whereas only a few studies pay attention to analyzing their features. In this paper, we propose a trust evaluation framework based on machine learning to facilitate human decision making by extensively considering multiple trust-related user features and criteria. We first divide user features into four groups according to the empirical analysis, including profile-based features, behavior-based features, feedback-based features, and link-based features. Then, we design a lightweight feature selection approach to evaluate the effectiveness of every single feature and find out the optimal combination of features from users' online records. We formalize trust analysis as a classification problem to simplify the verification process. We compare the performance of our features with four other feature sets proposed in the existing research. Moreover, four traditional trust evaluation methods are employed to compare with our machine learning based methods. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show that the overall performance of our features and methods is superior to the other existing features and traditional approaches.},

abstract={Cloud computing is integrated lots of computing resources which are provided to users over the Internet on a Pay-As-You-Go mode. While multi-tenants and resources sharing are its advantages under the cloud computing environment, it also brings new risks in information security. One of the more difficult consequences of an attack is a flooding attack. This attack is to exhaust the network bandwidth and the computing resources of the server, causing the server to fail to provide services due to heavy workload and may affect the normal service. Other servers in the same infrastructure cause unpredictable losses. Based on the existing DDoS detection technology, this paper proposes a prevention mechanism based on feature selection and random forest classification models to detect hybrid flooding attacks, called HFADS. The HFADS scheme is mainly divided into three modules: (1) Resource Monitor Module (2) Data Features Selection Module (3) Machine Learning Evaluation Module. Based on the above three modules, we perform some simulations for HFADS to be compared with Mouhammd Alkasassbeh et al.'s method to detect flooding attacks of DDoS in terms of three KPIs including recall rate, accuracy rate and average processing time. The final experimental results indicate that HFADS can achieve 99.99% for UDP, 99.95% for ICMP and 99.99% for HTTP in recall rate, 99.98% in accuracy rate and 65.34 seconds in average processing time. Consequently, the proposed HFADS is more effective and efficient than Mouhammd Alkasassbeh et al.'s method for the identification of hybrid flooding attacks.},

abstract={Current power systems have been undergoing in depth changes by the increasing share of renewable generation. At one hand, the grid is progressively more interconnected in order to collect the renewable generation from geographically dispersed places and to reduce the risks of intermittency; on the other hand, the power is increasingly generated at relative low voltage networks which in turn gives rise to new challenges in the conventional system design. The ambitious Danish governmental objective of greenhouse gas reduction accelerates adoptation of the renewables. The effect of this has to be carefully evaluated to secure the operation at both transmission and distribution levels. The fluctuations from wind and solar may rapidly degradate the security of the system such as overloading, voltage stability issues, etc. The Danish SOSPO project is launched from 2012 targeting at the system security assessment in the control room for the future scenarios. Methods will be developed in this project to counteract with the future challenges, and a testing platform will be developed in the laboratory for algorithm testing and demonstration.},

abstract={Business forecast is a biggest factor which generally affects the economical condition of any Financial Industry. If the forecast model is not a better one then it can cause liquidation and spoil the trust of customers in the market. Early predictions based on social media clients' opinion plays a major role in order to reduce risk on business and keep the trust of customer. According to the survey done by Fintech's world topic analysis is treated as one of the vital factor used for the determination of client's trends and for forecast analysis. Here we have performed a comparative analysis upon the social media data provide by Twitter in order to get an idea about the perception and understanding of clients' requirements across the world. For the experimentation purpose we have used Tweeter data for tweet analysis, for stock price we have yahoo finance data and for number of stocks we have used morning star data set. For the processing of Tweets given by the clients we have built an automated system using Deep Learning. Here the problem is divided in to 2 parts. In first part Text classification is done using Tensorflow and Keras, Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK-NLP).In this part using topic analysis the past tweet history is analyzed. In second part we are predicting forecastto identify multiple key business factors using Long Short term Memory (LSTM) using python/Rto. The actual aim of the system is to discover the effect of 3 fundamental parameters like security breaches, innovation, and stock exchange which are present in tweet given by the customers. Here the analysis is done on the last ten years tweets given by the clients for prediction of upcoming seven-day as well as monthly Market Cap. The actual intention of the work done here is to uncover the major diversity among two banks and bridge up the 3 gaps data breach, innovation and stock exchange in the available models. The latest information obtained in the system offers advantages to both Bank and customers to forecast Market value for the unbeaten estimation. We have obtained a prediction accuracy of 70.74% and 54.55% for monthly prediction and for weekly prediction we have obtained accuracy of 83.44% and 76.06% for Bank A and Bank B.},

abstract={In this paper we provide a technical solution to combine the two factors automation and user motivation that help to realize sustainable smart spaces. To support these factors, commonly central components provided by energy providers or by public social networks like Facebook are used. Approaches that are based on a centralized architecture are problematic for various reasons, including making consumers dependent on a single operator, and introducing privacy risks. This paper presents the Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS), a fully decentralized approach for solving the connectivity problem in and between smart spaces. DS2OS connects entities of a smart space with each other and with trusted remote smart spaces of friends. A focus of the presentation lays on security, and establishing friendship relationships. The security is based on X.509 certificates for authentication. Secure friendship relationships are established by locally issued certificates for remote friends. This way a web of trust of distributed entities can emerge between spatially distributed smart spaces. The presented solutions foster the emergence of smart neighborhoods by offering more flexibility and being more privacy-friendly than centralized solutions. Their use is illustrated with four scenarios for (a) Reducing Peak Demands and Demand Adaptation in Energy Consumption, (b) Neighbor Accounting and Distributed Energy Generation, (c) Neighborhood Coordination, and (d) Sharing of Data and Knowledge.},

These security vulnerabilities continue to infect the web applications through injection attacks. SQL injection attacks (SQLIA's) are one of the top most threat in database centric web application and SQL injections vulnerabilities(SQLIV's) are the most serious Vulnerability types.SQLIA allows the attacker to gain control over the database of an application resulting in financial fraud, Leak of confidential data, network hacking, deleting database, theft and many more to count.

abstract={Cloud computing is one of the most emerging field in the IT Industry which provides scalable, expandable and almost perfectly elastic software or hardware services to the users. As the scalability and elasticity of cloud computing services increases, it also increases the risk of malicious intervention into cloud. Since the number and types of malware attacks are increasing day by day, it triggers the need of an efficient, robust and scalable malware detection approach for securing virtual domains running in cloud. In this paper, we propose a dynamic analysis approach, called VMAnalyzer which applies deep learning based machine learning techniques for detecting attacks at VM-layer in cloud environment. The VMAnalyzer extracts the ordered sequence of system calls of all the monitored programs and performs the two-layer classification. In layer-1, convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to extract and select the relevant system call sequences. A number of potentially diverse layers in CNN not only provides the architecture for important feature extraction but also take care of convolution of n-grams with full sequential modelling. The layer-1 output is fed as a input to layer-2 using pipelining. In layer-2, Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is applied for learning and detecting the behavior of malicious system call sequences. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previously used methods for malware detection in cloud. The approach has been validated using University of New Maxico (UNM) dataset and results seem to be promising.},

abstract={Historically communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) technologies were designed independently and operated in a siloed fashion. As 4D trajectory-based operations (TBO), connected aircraft, system wide information management (SWIM) systems, and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are fast becoming reality, an aviation internet, that will enable fast, safe, secure, and cost-effective information sharing across CNS and air traffic management (ATM) domains is emerging as a necessary approach to cope with the challenge of ATM in complex operational environments.The aviation internet will leverage commercial Internet Protocols (IP) and information security technologies to establish an internetworking capability across CNS functions for both manned and unmanned aircraft. Both United States and European Union have set the goal of implementing an interoperable IP-based aviation network around the 2028 timeframe. As more and more aviation stakeholders are eager to contribute to the aviation internet standardization and validation, a practical and systematic transition plan that will orchestrate aviation stakeholders' efforts to achieve common mission objectives is crucial to the success of aviation internet transformation.In support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) CNS strategy, we first take a systems engineering approach to investigate key practical aspects of the whole lifecycle of the aviation internet transition, including technical standards suitability, regulatory and policy support, acquisition and investment decision process, business model, cost/benefit, market offerings, necessary validation, and implementation activities. Based on the investigation, we then identify technical, regulatory, and programmatic risks and corresponding mitigations, and provide technical feedback to the standardization groups. Finally, we present an action plan for the aviation industry stakeholders to ensure a successful transition from today's closed custom network to tomorrow's IP-based aviation internet.},

abstract={Substantial growth in networking and our increasing dependence on it has led to the evolution of the security concerns to another level. With increasing vulnerabilities in the system, the number of possible security breaches also shows an upward trend. With such growing concern for security, the researchers began with the quantitative modeling of vulnerabilities termed as vulnerability discovery models (VDM). A vulnerability discovery model illustrates changes in the vulnerability detection rate in a software system during its lifecycle. They can be used to gauge risk based on which possible mitigation methodologies can be planned. It helps the IT managers and developers to allocate their resources optimally by timely development and application of patches. Such models also allow the end-users to assess security risk in their systems. In this paper, we have introduced a modified Alhazmi-Malaiya Logistic (AML) Model for vulnerability discovery process in the software systems. In addition, we formulate a stochastic differential equation based vulnerability discovery model (VDM) for quantitative assessment of vulnerabilities which effectively captures the current industrial scenario. The proposed VDM is obtained by using stochastic approach in the modified AML Model. The model developed is validated on real life software data sets.},

We propose trust based information sharing among the CoI users of these IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and at a given time. This rated knowledge of various environments would enable a user's mobile device to automatically decide whether or not the user should visit this place/environment.

abstract={Growing complexity in modern software is making signature-based intrusion detection an increasing challenge. Many recent intrusion detection systems rely on accurate recovery of application semantics from memory. In this paper, we approach the problem from a different angle. We observe that the user applications in corporate network often run in identical system environments due to standardized IT deployment procedure. The same applications share similar runtime statistics across different workstations through out the time, despite different uses by the end users. When an application is compromised on one workstation, its runtime profile would be different from the rest, similar to how a black penguin would look distinctly different from the rest of the colony. In this work, we present our preliminary study on Black Penguin, a compare-view based intrusion detection system leveraging homogeneity of application-level memory statistics in corporate environment. The detection system follows a three-step process that includes memory analysis, unsupervised learning and risk mitigation. To explore the feasibility of Black Penguin, we conduct two types of experiments using Internet Explorer and Firefox as target applications. First, we examine the statistical differences of the same application under different user usage. To this end, we collect and analyze memory statistics of browser when visiting the top 500 websites ranked by Moz. Second, we examine the difference when the application is under attack. Several browser attacks are used to generate the intrusion samples. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. Lastly, we also provide discussions on the limitations of the proposed system as well as future directions.},

abstract={Ad hoc networks are autonomous distributed networks without the fixed communication infrastructures such as base stations. Ad hoc networks are at risk of a variety of attacks such as node capture attacks that result in tampering or leaking data. The secure dispersed data transfer method is a method to prevent node capture attacks. The performance of the dispersed data transfer method can be improved by the specific configuration of its parameters and using multiple paths with few bottleneck nodes. In this paper, we propose a configuration to maximize performance of the multipath routing method, which reduces the control packet count and reduce bottlenecking between shared elements. We have implemented our proposed method with the secure dispersed data transfer method on a network simulator, to confirm its effectiveness. In this paper, we discuss the appropriate parameters that give a promising advantage to the secure dispersed data transfer method.},

abstract={Mobile cloud computing provides a novel e-commerce mode for organizations without any upfront investment. Since cloud computing uses distributed resources in open environment, it is important to provide secure keys to share the data for developing cloud computing applications. To ensure a correctness of users' data in the cloud, we propose an effective and secure distributed model including a Self-Proxy Server (SPS) with self-created algorithm. The model resolves a communication bottleneck due to re-encryption of a shared data in the cloud whenever users are revoked. It offers to reduce security risks and protect their resources because a distributed SPS dynamically interacts with Key Manager (KM) when the mobile users take on cloud services. This paper presents a comprehensive mobile cloud design which provides an effective and secure cloud computing services on mobile devices.},

abstract={Climate change is now more visible in the form of frequent changes in the weather patterns leading to severe drought or floods. It endangers the food security, especially shrinking of cultivable land and increasing population. Agricultural Research Institutes are working on new cropping patterns, new heat and flood tolerant varieties and cultivation practices. However in the absence of sound knowledge extension system the results of such massive and costly research do not reach its end users, in this case farmers, on time. This research paper talks about the, National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP) pilot conducted to develop strategies to enhance Adaptive Capacity to Climate Change in vulnerable regions in India. As part of this research, extensive field demonstrations and data analysis were done to demonstrate how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can play a crucial role in establishing a two way connect between the Research Lab and the end users of research. While Agricultural research can focus on identification of current and future risks to livelihoods due to climatic variability and development or identification of regional climate specific crop varieties and crop practices, the IT and ICT can work jointly to use the outcome of such research to spread awareness and promote the use of such varieties and practices in adaptation by farmers and other stakeholders through an ICT platform.},

abstract={The ability to stay connected with friends online and share information, has accounted for the popularity of online social networking websites. However, the overwhelming task of access control policy management for information shared on these websites has resulted in various mental models of sharing with a false sense of privacy. The misalignment between a user's intended and actual privacy settings causes access control misconfigurations, raising the risk of unintentional privacy leaks. In this paper, we propose a scheme to extract the user's mental model of sharing, enhance this model using information learned from their existing policies, and enable them to compose misconfiguration free policies. We present the possible misconfiguration patterns based on which we scan the Facebook user's access control policies. We implemented a prototype Facebook application of our scheme and conducted a pilot study using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our preliminary results show that the users' intended policies were significantly different than their actual policies. Our scheme was able to detect the misconfiguration patterns in album policies. However, the reduction in the number of misconfigurations after using our approach was not significant. Participants' perceptions of our proposed policy misconfiguration patterns and the usability of our scheme was positive.},

abstract={Series capacitor compensation of AC transmission systems provides an economical solution for the power transmission companies to increase maximum power carrying capacity of existing transmission lines, control of load sharing of parallel lines and enhance transient stability. However, looking at it from generating utility point of view, the series compensation of lines may lead to possible subsynchronous resonance (SSR), in case of transient faults, of turbine generator units resulting in fatigue life reduction of turbine generator rotors and even damages which may prove to be very costly. In power stations having more than one bus connected parallel generating units, the SSR consequences depend on the number of units in parallel operation at the time of transient fault occurrence. In this paper, these consequences have been simulated for different combinations of parallel operating units for a power station having five generating units to determine the worst case combination. Simulations have been done for varying compensation ratio. Acceptable value of series compensation ratio has been determined considering worst case operating units combination and the fatigue limit of turbine geneerator rotor. Frequency domai analysis of electrical torque to determine the turbine generator rotor natural frequencies, frequency scanning of passive electrical network reactance viewed from a point behind the generator stator winding to determine the network natural frequencies, and finally the time domain simulation to capture the system dynamics following a transient fault have been demonstrated for different operating unit combinations. Simulation methodology demonstrated in this paper can prove to be very useful for system planning decisions related to determining SSR risks of series compensation for bus connected parallel generating units.},

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a network based security technology built for detecting vulnerability exploits against a target application or computer. Computational Intelligence (CI) refers to a set of nature-inspired computational methodologies and approaches to address complex real world problems; solutions to these problems may not be possible through mathematical reasoning. The objective of the paper is to account for cloud intrusions, various classifications of IDS along with CI in cloud. The paper discusses the inter-link between the intrusion detection methods and computational intelligence in a cloud environment.

abstract={Modern cars are equipped with a wide variety of sensors generating continually growing amounts of data. This data is transmitted via bus systems such as Controller Area Network (CAN) inside of the vehicle to the microcontroller-based Electronic Control Units. By connecting the vehicle to its surroundings using wireless interfaces, this data becomes accessible to the vehicle manufacturer from a distance. Through the opening to the outside, cyber attacks can exploit these interfaces and introduce major risks to the privacy and safety of vehicle users. Hence, suitable methods for vehicle security monitoring such as intrusion detection and logging are needed. In this work, we focus on the logging of network data, since this data is useful for the development of security updates, countermeasures and incident signatures. On this account, we propose a new method to aggregate the data of the CAN bus. The method combines CAN frames into so-called flows. Each flow contains a set of packets that share a certain common attribute (e.g.: frame type and identifier). To integrate security monitoring of vehicle fleets seamlessly into backend server systems, the gathered CAN flow data is stored in an industry standard data format. Additionally, the payload data is included in the flow format using a compression algorithm to leverage deep-packet inspection. The evaluation results with realworld vehicle data indicate that in our case about 40 % reduction of the overall data size is possible with our method compared to industry-standard formats for storing CAN frames.

abstract={Named Data Network (NDN) is an alternative to host-centric networking exemplified by today's Internet. One key feature of NDN is in-network caching that reduces access delay and query overhead by caching popular contents at the source as well as at a few other nodes. Unfortunately, in-network caching suffers various privacy risks by different attacks, one of which is termed timing attack. This is an attack to infer whether a consumer has recently requested certain contents based on the time difference between the delivery time of those contents that are currently cached and those that are not cached. In order to prevent the privacy leakage and resist such kind of attacks, we propose a detection scheme by adopting Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model. Based on the four input features of LSTM, cache hit ratio, average request interval, request frequency, and types of requested contents, we timely capture more important eigenvalues by dividing a constant time window size into a few small slices in order to detect timing attacks accurately. We have performed extensive simulations to compare our scheme with several other state-of-the-art schemes in classification accuracy, detection ratio, false alarm ratio, and F-measure. It has been shown that our scheme possesses a better performance in all cases studied.},

abstract={As a consequence of government objectives in terms of CO2 reduction and with the aim of increasing the share of renewable energy sources within the power system of Europe, offshore sites for wind power gain more and more importance. Within the last years the installed capacity of offshore wind reached 3 GW in the German Bight of the North Sea, most of them being connected through high voltage direct current (hvdc) transmission systems. Since the capacity of installed offshore transmission systems is increasing, redundancy is of great interest to guarantee system security in case of contingencies. This contribution investigates the possibility of offshore ac interconnections to reduce the risk of wind power being curtailed due to network outages and evaluates the economic feasibility of such grid expansion projects. The interconnection of BorWin gamma and DolWin beta is chosen as study case. For this purpose, reliability analyses are performed together with load flow studies based on wind power time series. In addition, economic considerations are carried out by means of investment evaluation. Reliability analyses are performed utilizing analytical Markov method in order to clearly distinguish system states in the latter process. The results show that ac interconnection can be beneficial for distances less than 40 km between converter stations assuming moderate reliability of offshore components. Furthermore, strong sensitivities are pointed out between the economic benefit and the reliability.},

pages={250-253},
abstract={The once-booming but scandal-ridden peer-to-peer lending industry robbed hundreds of thousands of retail investors of their life savings in the past several years. This paper examines the possibility and feasibility of identifying P2P lending firm non-normal business operation and the exits with the nature of frauds by using company's ownership structure characteristics. This paper adopts the penetrated shareholder compositions of P2P lending firms to construct their shareholding Ego-networks, and proposes an Ego-network clustering approach to describe and compare ownership structures of P2Ps. We find that there are two kinds of groups: the majority is that with a small amount of shareholders spread in shallow equity levels, while the minority is that with more shareholders, deeper equity structures and more complex cross-holding relationships. This paper mainly studies whether equity structural characteristics can be used to detect the frauds of P2P firms. Hence, classification algorithms are used, and logistic regression models with different P2P shareholding Ego-network characteristics are also employed to complete and explain the identification results. We confirm that firm's ownership structure can provide useful information for fraud detection. For example, P2P lending companies which are held by fewer direct and indirect shareholders, have fewer connections among related equity systems, and are held by shareholders with lower centralities in ownership Ego-networks are more likely to non-normally exit because of fraud risk events.},
