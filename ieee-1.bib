abstract={Vulnerability management remains a significant challenge for organizations that handle critical infrastructure worldwide. Hallmark cyber-physical incidents with disruptive and destructive capabilities like Stuxnet (2010) and Triton (2017) have exploited known vulnerabilities in information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) assets throughout the attack lifecycle. However, the global critical infrastructure security community is still nascent in the field of industrial control systems (ICS) vulnerability management, especially in information-sharing. While their counterparts in IT security have spent years elaborating multiple resources to track and disseminate information about known vulnerabilities, the ICS community lacks specialized mechanisms for knowledge-sharing. Multiple challenges exist when addressing this issue: a general lack of awareness about ICS cybersecurity, the need to consider multiple industry sectors and unique network architectures, and the need to find a balance between protecting and releasing sensitive information regarding critical infrastructure organizations or proprietary vendor knowledge. Through a multiphase research initiative based on the user-centered design process, we intend to test and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of various information-sharing platform designs for streamlining the discussion of ICS vulnerabilities. In the first phase of this research, we surveyed ICS and critical infrastructure security stakeholders to gain insight into the range of cogent, shared, and divergent views of the community relating to the need for specialized resources to share information about ICS vulnerabilities. We then evaluated what these different perspectives imply for the adoption and success of certain information-sharing platform frameworks. Finally, utilizing these insights, we demonstrated possible alternative paths forward for addressing the challenge of sharing information about ICS vulnerabilities to keep critical infrastructure safe.},

abstract={Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the process of using tools and information to passively learn enough information about an organization to begin the cyber attack cycle. OSINT gathering is often the first step in a malicious cyber campaign. Social Media and the Internet (e.g., search engines, open source tools, blogs) are quickly becoming invaluable sources of information for malicious cyber actors. These two very popular forms of technology are notorious for inherently accumulating and archiving personal information about people, organizations, and networks. These technologies also give information perpetual life, which can be summoned at any time by those in possession of the right knowledge (i.e., Data Science) and tools to extract this information. We posit that the extent of these privacy violations have increased to the point where OSINT identified vulnerabilities may be as useful to attackers as zero-day vulnerabilities, since organizations are likely just as unaware of their presence. We refer to the tools and techniques used to identify these types of vulnerabilities as privacy violating OSINT (PV-OSINT). In this paper, we bring to light the very serious damage that can be done to critical infrastructure (CI), by the use of PV-OSINT. We tested our methodology with a real CI, we then shared our findings with the CI owner to verify the efficacy of our approach. Then we developed a framework that could be used by CI owners to constantly assess the security of their networks using PV-OSINT.},

abstract={Modern critical infrastructures are characterized by a high degree of complexity, in terms of vulnerabilities, threats, and interdependencies that characterize them. The possible causes of a digital assault or occurrence of a digital attack are not simple to identify, as they may be due to a chain of seemingly insignificant incidents, the combination of which provokes the occurrence of scalar effects on multiple levels. Similarly, the digital explosion of technologies related to the critical infrastructure and the technical characteristics of their subsystems entails the continuous production of a huge amount of data from heterogeneous sources, requiring the adoption of intelligent techniques for critical analysis and optimal decision making. In many applications (e.g. network traffic monitoring) data is received at a high frequency over time. Thus, it is not possible to store all historical samples, which implies that they should be processed in real time and that it may not be possible to re-review old samples (one-pass constraint). We should consider the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combined with the fact that many of these systems are cyber-attack targets, but they cannot easily be disconnected from their layout as this could lead to generalized operational problems. This research paper proposes a Multi-Task Learning model for Real-Time & Large-Scale Data Analytics, towards the Cyber protection of Critical Infrastructure. More specifically, it suggests the Multi Overlap LEarning STReaming Analytics (MOLESTRA) which is a standardization of the "Kappa" architecture. The aim is the analysis of large data sets where the tasks are executed in an overlapping manner. This is done to ensure the utilization of the cognitive or learning relationships among the data flows. The proposed architecture uses the k-NN Classifier with Self Adjusting Memory (k-NN SAM). MOLESTRA, provides a clear and effective way to separate the short-term from the long-term memory. In this way the temporal intervals between the transfer of knowledge from one memory to the other and vice versa are differentiated.},

A review of the literature on the subjects of critical infrastructures, threats to the power grids, defense system concepts, and the special protection systems is reported. The proposed Strategic Power Infrastructure Defense (SPID) system methodology is a real-time, wide-area, adaptive protection and control system involving the power, communication, and computer infrastructures. The SPID system performs the failure analysis, vulnerability assessment, and adaptive control actions to avoid catastrophic power outages. This paper also includes a new concept for bargaining by multiagents to identify the decision options to reduce the system vulnerability. The concept of a flexible configuration of the wide-area grid is substantiated with an area-partitioning algorithm. A 179-bus system is used to illustrate the area partitioning method that is intended to minimize the total amount of load shedding.},

abstract={Critical infrastructure (CI) is vital for the overall economic growth and its reliable and safe operation is essential for a nation's stability and people's safety. Proper operation of the assets is essential for such a system and any threats that could negatively impact the asset could have a severe disruption. Risk management is an important aspect of the protection of CI. There are several frameworks and methodologies for identifying assets, quantifying and analysing vulnerabilities. However, there is a lack of focus on the interdependencies among the assets and cascading effect of the inherent vulnerabilities on the asset. This study attempts to bridge that gap by presenting a novel asset focus risk management approach for the CI. It presents a systematic methodology for identifying and analysing critical assets, their potential vulnerabilities, threats and risks facing CI. This work taking into account cascading vulnerability impacts on assets leading to threats and causing risk. The authors use a running example from a smart grid system to demonstrate the usability of the approach. The result shows that some assets are prioritised and more vulnerable than other assets for the power grid system and it can severely impact on the overall business continuity.},

abstract={The modern critical infrastructures (Power grids, Power plants, gas and oil pipelines etc.) are nowadays strongly interconnected at national and international level. The failure of one of them can originate cascading effects which might have serious and disastrous impact on others, even geographically far, infrastructures. The exchange of information about vulnerabilities, threats, countermeasures among the different actors of such interleaved systems assumes a not negligible role in the prevention of continental disasters. Due to their intrinsic nature, such information has to be considered strongly confidential and sensitive. Cope with the two needs of ¿share information¿ preserving the ¿confidentiality¿ according to some criteria, is the big obstacle in the creation of effective critical infrastructure information sharing networks. In this paper we present an extension of the well known Trust-X negotiation framework, which allows to address the confidentiality problem in the context of information sharing for critical infrastructures.},

abstract={A space-based system plays a vital role within national critical infrastructures. They are being incorporated into energy distribution software, advanced air-traffic management applications, rail signalling systems, etc. These infrastructures are susceptible to a broad range of security threats thus unfortunately; the end users of communications, location sensing and timing applications often fail to understand these infrastructures. This paper focus on concerns related with potential cyber-attacks. These are very important because future attacks may overthrow many of the safety assumptions that support the condition of critical space-based services. These safety assumptions are based on standard forms of hazard analysis that ignore cyber-security considerations This is a significant limitation when, for instance, security attacks can simultaneously exploit multiple vulnerabilities in a manner that would never occur without a deliberate enemy seeking to damage space based systems and ground infrastructures. The main motive of this research work is to identify attack scenarios that justify the allocation of additional design resources so that safety barriers can be strengthened to increase our flexibility against security threats.},

The simulation applies a formal model of the target system that describes the system nodes, the components with their vulnerabilities, and the logical topology.

abstract={A power system can become vulnerable for various reasons, these sources of vulnerability are either internal or external to the infrastructure that comprises the power system. Threats from vulnerability sources that are internal to the civil infrastructure may be reduced by decreasing the probability and severity of occurrence through the improved engineering of related systems. On the other hand, threats from vulnerability sources that are external to the infrastructure may be reduced by decreasing the severity of occurrence. To prevent or reduce catastrophic failures and cascading sequences of events caused by the various sources of vulnerability, the Advanced Power Technologies Consortium is researching ways to revolutionize defense strategies and technologies that will significantly reduce the vulnerability of the power infrastructure. Our vision is a wide-area, intelligent, adaptive protection and control system that empowers future grids by providing critical and extensive information in real time, assessing system vulnerability quickly, and performing timely self-healing and adaptive reconfiguration actions based on system-wide analysis. The proposed system is referred to as the strategic power infrastructure defense (SPID) system. The article discusses the conceptual design of the SPID system and the associated technical challenges. The fundamentally important concept is that the SPID system provides self-healing and adaptive reconfiguration capabilities for power grids based on wide-area system vulnerability assessment. Some experts believe that if 0.4% of the load had been shed for 30 minutes, the widespread power outage in the Western United States on 10 August 1996 could have been avoided. The SPID is intended to identify such load-shedding actions in real time based on proposed vulnerability assessment and protection/control systems.},

As the important components of critical infrastructure, if attacked, will behave abnormal and result in disasters to society countries and national economy. As one of the most import industrial protocols applied widely in the industry field, OPC is responsible to provide producing related data to HMI and database gathered from field devices like PLC and RTU. Because of the unique nature of industrial control system, traditional fuzzing technology cannot be applied to vulnerability detecting of OPC protocols directly. So it is urgent to develop a novel fuzzing technology for OPC protocol. This paper first described motivation of vulnerability detecting for OPC with fuzzing tool, then introduced the design and implementation of fuzzing technology for OPC protocol, the structure, workflow and algorithm is also described in detail. Finally, a experiment for OPC protocol fuzzing is proposed and the result is analyzed, some conclusion can be reached that the fuzzing technology proposed in this paper can fully satisfy the requirement of vulnerability detecting of OPC protocol.},

The Community Cyber Security Maturity Model (CCSMM) was proposed to help communities establish viable and sustainable cyber security programs. Information Sharing is an important part of the CCSMM but there are significant aspects to be explored. Collaborative information sharing helps a community detect potential risks and prevent cyber attacks at an early stage. It also facilitates incident response as well as preparedness activities in communities.

abstract={The vulnerability of military installations and critical infrastructure sites from underwater threats is now well accepted and, in order to combat these security weaknesses, there has been growing interest in - and adoption of - sonar technology. Greater availability of Autonomous/Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (A/UUVs) to both adversary nations and terrorists/saboteurs is also a cause of increasing concern. The small size and low acoustic target strength/signature of these vehicles presents significant challenges for sonar systems. The well-known challenges of the underwater environment, particularly in a harbor or port setting, can lead to a Nuisance Alarm Rate (NAR) that is higher than that of traditional security sensors (e.g. CCTV). This, in turn, can lead to a lack of confidence from end users and a possibility that `real' alerts are incorrectly dism issed. In the past this has been addressed by increasing the capability of individual sensors, leading to ever-increasing sensor complexity, however, the relationship between sensor performance and complexity/cost is highly non-linear. Even with the most complex and capable sensors, the fundamental limit to performance is often limited by acoustics, not sensor capability. In this paper we describe an alternative approach to reducing NAR and improving detection of difficult targets (e.g. UUVs), through intelligent combination and fusion of outputs from multiple sensors and data/signal processing algorithms. We describe the statistical basis for this approach, as well as techniques, methodologies and architectures for implementation. We describe the approach taken in our prototype algorithms/system, as well as quantitative and qualitative results from testing in a real-world environment. These results show a significant reduction in NAR and increase in classiflcation/alert range. Finally, we describe current focus areas for algorithmic and system development in both the short and medium term, as well as future extensions of these techniques to more classes of sensors, so that more challenging problems can be addressed.},

abstract={Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV a.k.a. driverless cars) offset human response for transportation infrastructure, enhancing traffic efficiency, travel leisure, and road safety. Behind the wheels of these mobile robots lies machine learning (ML) to automate mundane driving tasks and make decisions from situational awareness. Attacking ML, the brain of driverless cars, can cause catastrophes. This paper proposes a novel approach to attack CAV by fooling its ML model. Using adversarial examples in CAVs, the work demonstrates how adversarial machine learning can generate attacks hardly detectable by current ML classifiers for CAV misbehavior detection. First, adversarial datasets are generated by a traditional attack engine, which CAV misbehavior detection ML models can easily detect. Building attack ML model takes two phases: training and testing. Using supervised learning, Phase I trains the model on the time-series data, converted from the adversarial datasets. Phase II tests the model, which leads, for the next round of model improvement. The initial round deploys K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, respectively. The next round, guided by deep learning (DL) models, uses Logistic Regression (LG) of neural network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) of recurrent neural network. The results, in precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, validate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial ML models. This work reveals the vulnerability in ML. At the same time, it shows the promise to protect critical infrastructure by studying the opponent strategies. Future work includes retraining the adversarial ML models with real-world datasets from pilot CAV sites.},

abstract={Nation's network infrastructure such as the Global Information Grid (GIG) for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the OneNet for the Homeland Security Department are tran-sitioning to the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) per DoD CIO Memorandum of June 2003 and the Office of Management and Budget memorandum OMB-05-22. There exist IPv6 specific security vulnerabilities in these network infrastructures that need to be mitigated in order to achieve security parity with the existing IPv4 operations. From the perspective of the Homeland Security technologies, the existence of additional security vulnerabilities implies a possibility for two pronged threats. First, the IPv6 specific vulnerabilities reduce the security posture of the network infrastructure itself; second, other critical infrastructure sectors that depend on IPv6 need additional protection. For example, the future supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) industrial capabilities would increasingly use the IPv6 infrastructure, as would the voice communications, the voice and video collaboration, and sharing of data such as the image data and surveillance and reconnaissance data. This paper presents three contiguous results. First, it briefly presents the new IPv6 capabilities; second, it presents a brief analysis of the security vulnerabilities arising from these capabilities; and third, it presents a new security model for IPv6 network infrastructures that has the potential to mitigate these vulnerabilities. The new model is based on the end-to-end connectivity that is restored in IPv6, thus allowing the use of host based security (HBS) systems together with the perimeter security devices. However, the use of HBS complicates the security trust management. Therefore the third component of the model is introduced, namely a policy based security management (PBSM) approach. The PBSM approach allows the secure deployment of the host based security systems. It provides the capabilities needed to specify the trust zones via a set of security policy rules that together specify a trust zone. Hosts belong to one or more trust zones. Accordingly, the host based security policies are derived from the zone security policies for all the zones to which a host belongs. In addition, the PBSM approach has the potential to support more sophisticated security capabilities such as a risk adaptive access control and dynamic security response to a changing operational picture. The capabilities are needed to enable net-centric security operations.},

abstract={Industrial control systems rely more and more on digital technologies. Although the cyber risk such technologies induce is widely judged as serious, especially for critical infrastructures, these systems have generally not been designed to serve cybersecurity purposes. Instead they were thought first for serving operational efficiency. It thus becomes critical to study cyber threats in industrial environments and experimental test beds are needed to evaluate risks, physical consequences of cyber incidents, and performance of countermeasures. The test bed we present here focuses on studying cyber risks and their mitigation in IEC 61850 power utility automation systems. The operational part is composed of engineering computers, supervision software, off-the-shelf intelligent relays (Intelligent Electronic Device - IED), a hardware-in-the-loop process simulation, and the cybersecurity tools include an attack generation station and a network analyzer. In this paper, we present the operational part, giving details on the power grid hardware-in-the-loop simulation and its importance in the understanding of cyber consequences on the global system. The article concludes giving preliminary experimental results showing consequences of a false data injection attack on a simple electrical architecture.},

abstract={Distributed intelligence and secure interconnected communication networks constitute recognized key factors for the economic operation of electricity infrastructures in competitive power markets. Hence, electric power utilities need to extend risk management frameworks with adequate tools for assessing consequences of ICT (information and communication technologies) threats on their critical business. This requires realistic probability estimates to cyber threat occurrences and consequent failure modes. Due to data sensitivity and rapid discovery of new vulnerability exploits, historical data series of ICT failures affecting power control infrastructures are not sufficient for a timely risk treatment. Such lack of data can partially be overcome by setting up testbeds to run controlled experiments and collect otherwise unavailable data related to cyber misbehaviours in power system operation. Within the project CRUTIAL (critical utility infrastructural resilience) two testbed platforms have been set up for experimentally evaluating malicious threats on macro and micro grid control scenarios. Results from experimental campaigns are analyzed in the paper by means of an evaluation framework.},

abstract={Information sharing about cyber incidents that affect the normal, safe operation of industrial control systems is not well coordinated or standardized across critical infrastructure sectors of the economy. Consequently there is little situational awareness about the frequency, type and extent of control system cyber incidents - a deficiency with potential national security implications. Control system disruption due to cyber rather than physical means is increasingly a concern of industry and government. More and more control systems utilize commercial off-the-shelf computer technology, and are inter-connected with business enterprise systems and the Internet. Not only are control systems in different sectors interdependent but the commonality of technology means that all sectors face a common cyber threat. These common cyber threats and vulnerabilities present the opportunity for common solutions to be adopted across industry sectors. The solutions include the elimination of vulnerabilities in control system designs and implementations. But with constantly evolving technology and the ever-present threat of cyber attack, tools are needed to support the early detection and timely reporting of control system cyber incidents. A Raytheon-led team is working in consultation with industry and government to define a standard protocol and data schema for the timely reporting of actual and potential cyber attacks on industrial control systems. Previous efforts to share cyber incident information have encountered barriers, including data confidentiality and detection of novel cyber attack methods. Potential solutions to these barriers and deployment approaches for information sharing tools based on the protocol standard are described.},

abstract={For more than 40 years, military strategists and astro-politicians have studied evolutionary and revolutionary needs for the protection of commercial SATCOM. In light of many valid reasons to protect user access to jamming, interference, direction finding, interception, intrusion, physical attack and nuclear effects, it is also necessary to recognize information warfare threats and vulnerabilities, as well as collaborative and distributed means for commercial systems to assist government and military systems under attack. In an ever-expanding mobile wireless smart phone and M2M infrastructure, as well as in the integration of broadband transport services and cloud computing, protection and security are a shared responsibility and liability across both government and commercial sectors. Commercial narrowband machine-to-machine (M2M) highlights the ability to offer four core emerging network services which will be further defined in this document: (1) Out-of-Band C2 for critical or complex platforms. (2) Cyber inoculation during network attack (3) Non-internet critical thread extranet communications and social tool integration. (4) Position, location, identity and timing restoral during network failure.},

abstract={Smart grid systems (SGSs) become a requirement to improve efficiency and reliability of the power generation, transmission, and particularly distribution systems. In order to maintain power networks with high performance as well as reducing operational cost, utility companies need to implement SGSs into their networks. Many smart grid initiatives leverage an increased dependency of information and communication technologies (ICT) to integrate more accurate physical parameter measurements and intelligent controller devices to the systems. It is well known that advancement in ICT provides easier and fast communication capabilities to SGSs to keep different components in power systems connected. However, the increased ICT dependency also introduces additional security risks for utility networks using SGSs resulting from poor system configurations, poor network design and vulnerabilities in software and operating platforms, lack of security policies and standards. Big Data Analytics also provides new perceptions and solutions to SGSs. This special session aims to bring together researchers and developers from academia, industry and governmental institution to share and exchange novel ideas, expectations, concerns and solutions, explore the inherent challenges in developing more secure SGSs with the current solutions and dig data analytics and share current experiences. Topics include, but are not limited to: · System security concerns · Vulnerabilities and threats · Security requirements for information and infrastructure · Security policies critical · Network security in smart grid · Operating system security · Communication protocol security · Application security · Malicious software threats and protections · Security risk analysis, modeling, evaluation and management · Machine to machine communication security · Growing concern for customers privacy · Standardization efforts and regulatory compliance · Secure design techniques and tools · Secure Monitor and control of distributed smart grid networks · Software security in smart grid · Industry 4.0 for SGSs · Big data analytics, technologies, techniques and solutions for Smart grids · Machine learning solutions for smart grid system security · IoT and IoE in smart grid application and implementation.},
