abstract={While the recent advances in data science and machine learning attract lots of attention in cyber security because of their promise for effective security analytics, vulnerability analysis, risk assessment, and security policy validation remain slightly aside. This is mainly due to the relatively slow progress in the theoretical formulation and the technological foundation of the cyber security concepts such as logical vulnerability, threats, and risks. In this article, we are proposing a framework for logical analysis, threat intelligence, and validation of security policies in cyber systems. It is based on multi-level model, consisting of ontology of situations and actions under security threats, security policies governing the security-related activities, and graph of the transactions. The framework is validated using a set of scenarios describing the most common security threats in digital banking, and a prototype of an event-driven engine for navigation through the intelligence graphs has been implemented. Although the framework was developed specifically for application in digital banking, the authors believe that it has much wider applicability to security policy analysis, threat intelligence, and security by design of cyber systems for financial, commercial, and business operations. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Security vulnerabilities of the modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems are unique, mainly due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the technology and data. The risks born out of these IoT systems cannot easily fit into an existing risk framework. There are many cybersecurity risk assessment approaches and frameworks that are under deployment in many governmental and commercial organizations. Extending these existing frameworks to IoT systems alone will not address the new risks that have arisen in the IoT ecosystem. This study has included a review of existing popular cyber risk assessment methodologies and their suitability to IoT systems. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation, Threat Assessment & Remediation Analysis, and International Standards Organization are the four main frameworks critically analyzed in this research study. IoT risks are presented and reviewed in terms of the IoT risk category and impacted industries. IoT systems in financial technology and healthcare are dealt with in detail, given their high-risk exposure. Risk vectors for IoT and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) are discussed in this study. A unique risk ranking method to rank and quantify IoT risk is introduced in this study. This ranking method initiates a risk assessment approach exclusively for IoT systems by quantifying IoT risk vectors, leading to effective risk mitigation strategies and techniques. A unique computational approach to calculate the cyber risk for IoT systems with IoT-specific impact factors has been designed and explained in the context of IoMT systems. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={In 2016, the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) provided key foundations and motivations for navigating towards an autonomous cybersecurity approach. Since that time, novel strides have been made in the areas of static analysis, vulnerability discovery, patching, and exploit generation. However, a majority of these efforts have been focused on enterprise systems, leaving a gap in the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) domain. With the rise of connected infrastructure and the introduction of 5G communications, CPS are becoming more ingrained within present-day society. Due to a large amount of legacy software, and control of safety-critical actuation, CPS are and will continue to be a huge attack vector for our adversaries to remotely deploy devastating attacks against our country with low economic cost and at scale. To combat this threat, we propose the need to apply the most beneficial concepts from the CGC to create more secure and resilient CPS. In this paper, we introduce a CPS security assessment architecture RUCKUS for autonomously identifying and analyzing CPS firmware, identifying vulnerabilities, and developing exploits. Further, our approach considers how to integrate graph analytics to extrapolate findings to firmware at scale, allowing for measuring the potential widespread impact of attacks. Our architecture is demonstrated using an automotive case study, leveraging firmware from the most popular automotive and router manufacturers to assess the real-world potential impact of CPS attacks. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Traditional techniques for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security design either treat the cyber and physical systems independently, or do not address the specific vulnerabilities of real time embedded controllers and networks used to monitor and control physical processes. In this work, we develop and test an integrated model-based approach for CPS security risk assessment utilizing a CPS testbed with real-world industrial controllers and communication protocols. The testbed monitors and controls an exothermic Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) simulated in real-time. CSTR is a fundamental process unit in many industries, including Oil & Gas, Petrochemicals, Water treatment, and nuclear industry. In addition, the process is rich in terms of hazardous scenarios that could be triggered by cyber attacks due to the lack of possible mechanical protection. The paper presents an integrated approach to analyze and design the cyber security system for a given CPS where the physical threats are identified first to guide the risk assessment process. A mathematical model is derived for the physical system using a hybrid automaton to enumerate potential hazardous states of the system. The cyber system is then analyzed using network and data flow models to develop the attack scenarios that may lead to the identified hazards. Finally, the attack scenarios are performed on the testbed and observations are obtained on the possible ways to prevent and mitigate the attacks. The insights gained from the experiments result in several key findings, including the expressive power of hybrid automaton in security risk assessment, the hazard development time and its impact on cyber security design, and the tight coupling between the physical and the cyber systems for CPS that requires an integrated design approach to achieve cost-effective and secure designs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The purpose of this article is to introduce a risk analysis framework to enhance the cyber security of and to protect the critical infrastructure of the electric power grid of the United States. Building on the fundamental questions of risk assessment and management, this framework aims to advance the current risk analysis discussions pertaining to the electric power grid. Most of the previous risk-related studies on the electric power grid focus mainly on the recovery of the network from hurricanes and other natural disasters. In contrast, a disproportionately small number of studies explicitly investigate the vulnerability of the electric power grid to cyber-attack scenarios, and how they could be prevented or mitigated. Such a limited approach leaves the United States vulnerable to foreign and domestic threats (both state-sponsored and “lone wolf”) to infiltrate a network that lacks a comprehensive security environment or coordinated government response. By conducting a review of the literature and presenting a risk-based framework, this article underscores the need for a coordinated U.S. cyber security effort toward formulating strategies and responses conducive to protecting the nation against attacks on the electric power grid. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis},

Determining the elements that participate in this field is difficult because there is no exclusive approach to cybersecurity. This document aims to provide a framework to identify and assess cybersecurity risks. For this, a systematic review of the studies related to cybersecurity risk taxonomies was carried out. The main elements of the proposed conceptual model and framework have been determined by applying the snowball technique. To validate the implementation of the proposed framework, a case study has been implemented at the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute. The first task was to consolidate the information in a baseline. Once the baseline was obtained, the defined framework has been applied. As a result, through the use of the proposed framework, the assessment process has improved the decision-making process regarding the importance and criticality of the risks and countermeasures that must be applied. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Threats of cyber attacks are very real today and greatly impact everything including the public health sector, economics, electric grids, internet of things (IoT), and national security. The number of new evolving threats and reported vulnerabilities has severely increased in the last few years [1]. Perpetually refined cyber-attacks have set data, organizational assets, organizations, and individuals at considerable risk. Protecting sophisticated networks and interdependent systems, or reducing the impact of cyber-attacks has become a major challenge, where today's effective countermeasures can be completely ineffective tomorrow. The various risk assessment frameworks and methodologies are either high-level, missing risk metrics values, not suitable for all kinds of networks, or publicly not available. To address this issue, we present a quantitative risk assessment model, that helps to model the organizational security posture, evaluates the security controls in place, and provides an understanding of the associated risks. We further provide a detailed explanation of the formulations and evaluate the proposed model on an industrial scenario. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In the recent era, the security issues affecting the future Internet-of-Things (IoT) standards has fascinated noteworthy consideration from numerous research communities. In this view, numerous assessments in the form of surveys were proposed highlighting several future IoT-centric subjects together with threat modeling, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various emergent technologies. In contrast, in this article, we have focused exclusively on the emerging IoT-related vulnerabilities. This article is a multi-fold survey that emphasizes on understanding the crucial causes of novel vulnerabilities in IoT paradigms and issues in existing research. Initially, we have emphasized on different layers of IoT architecture and highlight various emerging security challenges associated with each layer along with the key issues of different IoT systems. Secondly, we discuss the exploitation, detection, and defense methodologies of IoT malware-enabled distributed denial of service (DDoS), Sybil, and collusion attack capabilities. We have also discussed numerous state-of-the-art strategies for intrusion detection and methods for IDS setup in future IoT systems. Third, we have presented a brief classification of existing IoT authentication protocols and a comparative analysis of such protocols based on different IoT-enabled cyber attacks. For conducting a real-time future IoT research, we have presented some emerging blockchain solutions. We have also discussed a comparative examination of some of the recently developed simulation tools and IoT test beds that are characterized based on different layers of IoT infrastructure. We have also outlined some of the open issues and future research directions and also facilitate the readers with broad classification of existing surveys in this domain that addresses several scopes related to the IoT paradigm.

abstract={There is an exponential growth in the number of cyber-attack incidents resulting in significant financial loss and national security concerns. Secure cyberspace has been designated as one of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges in engineering. Broadly, the security threats are targeted on software programs, operating system and network with the intention to launch confidentiality, integrity and availability violations. Existing undergraduate and graduate-level cybersecurity education curriculum rely primarily on didactic teaching methods with little focus on student centered, inquiry-based teaching, known to improve student learning. With growing number of security incidents taking place, it is of utmost importance to prepare a workforce equipped with knowledge of the threat space and existing state-of-the-art solutions. Such comprehensive understanding is only possible by a dedicated hands-on course on cybersecurity where students can learn the key concepts by editing the hardware, software and OS, and, network policies. Unfortunately, such extensive and deep flexibilities are not provided in current cybersecurity curriculum. In this paper, we introduce a hands-on and modular self-learning Cybersecurity Training (CST) Kit to advance cybersecurity education. Students can promptly apply newly acquired knowledge on the CST Kit as part of the learning process. This Kit accompanies Do-It-Yourself (DIY) training modules that is used to model and investigate cybersecurity issues and their prevention to all levels of the cybersecurity workforce, including undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 science and technology teachers. The Kit also covers various aspects of cybersecurity issues including, hardware, software, operating system and network security. A coursework has been developed on hardware security for senior undergraduate and graduate students using the Kit. A preliminary survey conducted among students who were introduced to the modular board to implement hardware security threats such as, side-channel attack shows an 120% improvement in their understanding after the CST Kit based activities. The components of the CST Kit have also been used in a 4-day summer workshop for K-12 teachers. Teachers took pre- and post- concept inventories to assess their learning of content throughout the workshop and the results indicated improvement of 58%. These assessments focused on vulnerabilities and specific types of attacks, system security, data transmission and encryption, permutations and combinatorics, and binary numbers. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.},

abstract={The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) enabled a new class of smart and interactive devices. With their continuous connectivity and their access to valuable information in both the digital and physical world, they are attractive targets for security attackers. Hence, with their integration into both the industry and consumer devices, they added a new surface for cybersecurity attacks. These potential threats call for special care of security vulnerabilities during the design of IoT devices and CPS. The design of secure systems is a complex task, especially if they must adhere to other constraints, such as performance, power consumption, and others. A range of design space exploration tools have been proposed in academics, which aim to support system designers in their task of finding the optimal selection of hardware components and task mappings. Said tools offer a limited way of modeling attack scenarios as constraints for a system under design. The framework proposed in this paper aims at closing this gap, offering system designers a way to consider security attacks and security risks during the early design phase. It offers designers to model security constraints from the view of potential attackers, assessing the probability of successful security attacks and security risk. The framework's feasibility and performance is demonstrated by revisiting a potential system design of an industry partner. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber threats directly affect the critical reliability and availability of modern Industry Control Systems (ICS) in respects of operations and processes. Where there are a variety of vulnerabilities and cyber threats, it is necessary to effectively evaluate cyber security risks, and control uncertainties of cyber environments, and quantitative evaluation can be helpful. To effectively and timely control the spread and impact produced by attacks on ICS networks, a probabilistic Multi-Attribute Vulnerability Criticality Analysis (MAVCA) model for impact estimation and prioritised remediation is presented. This offer a new approach for combining three major attributes: vulnerability severities influenced by environmental factors, the attack probabilities relative to the vulnerabilities, and functional dependencies attributed to vulnerability host components. A miniature ICS testbed evaluation illustrates the usability of the model for determining the weakest link and setting security priority in the ICS. This work can help create speedy and proactive security response. The metrics derived in this work can serve as sub-metrics inputs to a larger quantitative security metrics taxonomy; and can be integrated into the security risk assessment scheme of a larger distributed system. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Vessels cybersecurity is gaining momentum as a result of a few recent attacks on vessels at sea. These recent attacks have shocked the maritime domain, which was thought to be relatively immune to cyber threats. That belief is now over, as proved by recent mandates issued by the International Maritime Organization. According to these regulations, all vessels should be the subject of a cybersecurity risk analysis, and technical controls should be adopted to mitigate the resulting risks. This initiative is laudable since, despite the recent incidents, the vulnerabilities and threats affecting modern vessels are still unclear to operating entities, leaving the potential for dreadful consequences of further attacks just a matter of "when,"not "if."In this contribution, we investigate and systematize the major security weaknesses affecting systems and communication technologies adopted in modern vessels. Specifically, we describe the architecture and main features of the different systems, pointing out their main security issues, and specifying how they were exploited by attackers to cause service disruption and relevant financial losses. We also identify a few countermeasures to the introduced attacks. Finally, we highlight a few research challenges to be addressed by industry and academia to strengthen vessels security. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Wi-Fi has been widely accepted in today's generation since it provides liberty to gain access to the network without being physically bonded. Some institutions believe this results in an increase in service and productivity, while reducing the cost of physical wiring; as users bring their devices such as laptops and tablets. With embracing the benefits of Wi-Fi, potential cyber threats can arise through this usage. This paper discusses the greater concern on security issues arising and assessment while embracing the benefits of Wi-Fi. Existing literature was used to evaluate the vulnerability assessment mechanisms available and propose recommendations that educational environments can further adopt, in addition to existing measures to better protect its users. © 2020 IST-Africa Institute and Authors.},

abstract={State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in the United States are responsible for a large portfolio of transportation modes and services, including passenger and freight systems. These responsibilities include operations under routine conditions and during incidents and events that result from various natural and human-caused hazards. During unexpected events, disruptions and reductions in service result in requiring the reallocation and reassignment of personnel, modal, and economic resources. To better prevent and respond to the effects of service disruptions, the concept of resilience has emerged as an important framework, within which, DOTs across the United States are using to plan for the occurrence of threats. In this paper, the key findings of recent reviews of literature and practice related to resilience among state DOTs in the United States are summarized. The review effort focused on a range of risks faced by transportation agencies including climate change, terrorism, cyber-attacks, and aging infrastructure and the ways in which DOTs are confronting them in practice. The topics of this paper range from the fundamental, including definitions of transportation resilience; to the more complex such as examinations of risk, vulnerability and threats; to the most sophisticated topics including administrative-level efforts to conceptualize evolving transportation planning and policies within a resilience framework. © 2019},

abstract={Cyber physical systems (CPS) has been hailed as the next future of computing by integrating information technology into physical systems to increase their capabilities. Information network is an organic part of CPS, and vulnerability threat assessment of information network is one of the important bases of CPS risk assessment. In view of the limitation of general information network vulnerability threat assessment technology, this paper proposes an information network vulnerability threat assessment model based on dynamic attack and defence game. Firstly, a risk assessment model suitable for CPS is constructed based on the actual control scheduling of information system. At the same time, considering the constraint conditions of both sides, including the quantity of available resources, rational allocation of resources, cost-effectiveness and the number of attacked nodes, a more perfect information network vulnerability threat assessment model is established. Then, on this basis, the dynamic attack and defence game function and game solution steps are designed to realize the quantitative assessment of information network vulnerability threat of CPS risk assessment. Finally, a simulation test based on IEEE 34-node information network system is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cyber security threats are increasing manifold, largely respective to the size of the organization. To defend against such threats, an organization must acquire proper security threat detection and incident handling capabilities. The vast majority of small & medium-sized enterprises lack a Security Information & Event Management (SIEM), which serves as the heart of a proper threat detection& incident handling process. The main cause for such lack is the constrains of cost in enterprises of such size, leaving them prone and vulnerable to advanced cyber threats more than ever by reverting to legacy security measures (e.g. port-based firewalls & signature-based IPS) for protection against the expanding cyber threat landscape. Therefore, a modular SIEM system is proposed aiming at enhancing the security of small & medium sized enterprises at no cost by utilizing open-source modules, bringing modern security to the organization, allowing it to stand a better chance at securing and defending its portion of cyberspace. The proposed SIEM system demonstrates rapid data collection, analytics, & visualization lending itself to aiding the organization in responsively and proactively monitoring and analyzing threats and incidents, while providing vulnerability management & host monitoring capabilities. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a part of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and a prevalent control system architecture that is commonly used for industrial automation. The SCADA systems play an integral role in large-scale processes for interfacing with transducers and machinery for real-time control and data acquisition. The increasing demand to integrate SCADA systems with remote networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies raises concerns for information security specialists. These systems are known to have notable security vulnerabilities and may be subject to an increasing number of cyber threats. This research work provides educational guidance on how to build and further study ICS, including SCADA systems in academia. The mobile system introduced in this paper allows researchers to further investigate cybersecurity analysis of the ICS components. There exists a need and demand to better understand these systems and the inherent security threats that come with them.

abstract={Increasing the number of threats against software vulnerabilities and rapidly growing data breaches have become a key concern for both the IT industry and stakeholders. Developing secure software systems when there is a high demand for software products from individuals as well as the organizations is in itself a big challenge for the designers and developers. Meanwhile, adopting traditional and informal learnings to address security issues of software products has made it easier for cyber-criminals to expose software vulnerabilities. Hence, it is imperative for the security practitioners to employ a symmetric mechanism so as to achieve the desired level of software security. In this context, a decision-making approach is the most symmetrical technique to assess the security of software in security tactics perspective. Since the security tactics directly address the quality attribute concerns, this symmetric approach will be highly effective in making the software systems more secure. In this study, the authors have selected three main attributes and fifteen sub-attributes at level 1 and level 2, respectively, with ten different software of an institute as alternatives. Furthermore, this study uses a fuzzy-based symmetrical decision-making approach to assess the security of software with respect to tactics. Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (F-ANP) is applied to evaluate the weights of criteria and fuzzy-Symmetrical technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to determine impact of alternatives. The proposed symmetrical assessment in this study will be beneficial for both the designers and developers to categorize and prioritize the security attributes and understand the importance of security tactics during software development life cycle. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Attacks on IT systems are a rising threat against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information and infrastructures. At the same time, the complex interplay of attack techniques and possible countermeasures makes it difficult to appropriately plan, implement, and evaluate an organization’s defense. More often than not, the worlds of technical threats and organizational controls remain disjunct. In this article, we introduce PenQuest, a meta model designed to present a complete view on information system attacks and their mitigation while providing a tool for both semantic data enrichment and security education. PenQuest simulates time-enabled attacker/defender behavior as part of a dynamic, imperfect information multi-player game that derives significant parts of its ruleset from established information security sources such as STIX, CAPEC, CVE/CWE and NIST SP 800-53. Attack patterns, vulnerabilities, and mitigating controls are mapped to counterpart strategies and concrete actions through practical, data-centric mechanisms. The gamified model considers and defines a wide range of actors, assets, and actions, thereby enabling the assessment of cyber risks while giving technical experts the opportunity to explore specific attack scenarios in the context of an abstracted IT infrastructure. We implemented PenQuest as a physical serious game prototype and successfully tested it in a higher education environment. Additional expert interviews helped evaluate the model’s applicability to information security scenarios. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={As the scale of the system and network grows, IT infrastructure becomes more complex and hard to be managed. Many organizations have a serious problem to manage their system and network security. In addition, vulnerabilities of hardware and software are increasing in number rapidly. In such a complex IT environment, security administrators need more practical and automated threat assessment methods to reduce their manual tasks. Adversary emulation based automated assessment is one of the solutions to solve the aforementioned problems because it helps to discover the attack paths and vulnerabilities to be exploited. However, it is still inefficient to perform the adversary emulation because adversary emulation requires well-designed attack scenarios created by security experts. Besides, a manual-based penetration test cannot be frequently performed. To overcome this limitation, we propose an adversary emulation framework composed of the red team and blue team agent. The red team agent carries out automated attacks based on the automatically generated scenarios by the proposed framework. The blue team agent deploys defense measures to react to the red team agent's attack patterns. To test our framework, we test multiple attack scenarios on remote servers that have various vulnerable software. In the experiment, we show the red team agent can gain an administrator's privilege from the remote side when the blue team agent's intervention is not enabled. The blue team agent can successfully block the red team's incoming attack when enabled. As a result, we show our proposed framework is beneficial to support routine threat assessment from the adversary's perspective. It will be useful for security administrators to make security defense strategy based on the test results. © 2020 by the authors.},

A layer of protection analysis (LOPA) is adapted to evaluate potential weaknesses and ensure safeguards for critical applications would be resistant to cyber-attacks. Integrating cybersecurity into hazard and risk analyses as well as other elements of process safety management (PSM) is demonstrated with examples, making the plant more resilient against both traditional and cyber threats. © 2020},

abstract={Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming the new gold standard in public health microbiology. Like any disruptive technology, its growing popularity inevitably attracts cyber security actors, for whom the health sector is attractive because it combines mission- critical infrastructure and high-value data with cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In this Perspective, we explore cyber security aspects of microbial NGS. We discuss the motivations and objectives for such attack, its feasibility and implications, and highlight policy considerations aimed at threat mitigation. Particular focus is placed on the attack vectors, where the entire process of NGS, from sample to result, could be vulnerable, and a risk assessment based on probability and impact for representative attack vectors is presented. Cyber attacks on microbial NGS could result in loss of confidentiality (leakage of personal or institutional data), integrity (misdetection of pathogens) and availability (denial of sequencing services). NGS platforms are also at risk of being used as propagation vectors, compromising an entire system or network. Owing to the rapid evolution of microbial NGS and its applications, and in light of the dynamics of the cyber security domain, frequent risk assessments should be carried out in order to identify new threats and underpin constantly updated public health policies. © 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

In this study, the sources of cybersecurity threats in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem are examined in the corporate and end-user dimensions. The cybersecurity vulnerabilities most evident in Industry 4.0 systems have been determined to consist of vulnerabilities in control systems protocols, unprotected thing connections, neglect of periodic infiltration tests, inability to manage network devices effectively and untrained personnel. The cyber defense strategies and requirements for these vulnerabilities have been determined. At the same time, corporates and end-users have been told how to implement these preventions. As a result, it is not possible to completely prevent cyber-attacks within the Industry 4.0 ecosystem. Preventing the vulnerabilities identified in the study will ensure that the damage is minimal in attacks. © 2020 MECS.},

abstract={The exponential growth of digital technologies experienced in the last decades has shaped contemporary societies so thoroughly to earn the definition of digital revolution or third industrial revolution. Along with the penetration rate of digital technologies, concerns about systems' vulnerability and the disruptive potential of malicious attacks have rapidly risen among governments and industries as much as in the eye of public opinion. Such concerns are all the more motivated when referring to the nuclear power industry which, due to historical and safety reasons, appears to be more unprepared and vulnerable to cyber threats than its industrial counterparts. While the isolation of plants' control network from the public internet, generally referred as air-gap, has for long nurtured the belief of security of nuclear power plants, recent events (e.g. Stuxnet worm) have shown the inadequacy of this countermeasure. Moreover, the progressive shift from obsolete analogue industrial and control systems to digital solutions, and the growing capabilities of attackers, are exacerbating the urge for novel strategies able to overcome the inadequacy of traditional risk assessment techniques in addressing such threats. This study focuses on cyber security challenges peculiar to the nuclear industry and argues the need for novel tools and radically new approaches to assess and mitigate the vulnerability of nuclear facilities to cyber threats. In order to achieve a full understanding of common attack mechanisms, relevant cyber threats targeting the instrumentation and control system of a generic nuclear power plant have been modelled graphically using a Petri net approach.

abstract={Critical manufacturing processes in smart networked systems such as Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) typically require guaranteed quality-of-service performances, which is supported by cyber-security management. Currently, most existing vulnerability-assessment techniques mostly rely on only the security department due to limited communication between different working groups. This poses a limitation to the security management of CPPSs, as malicious operations may use new exploits that occur between successive analysis milestones or across departmental managerial boundaries. Thus, it is important to study and analyse CPPS networks’ security, in terms of vulnerability analysis that accounts for humans in the production process loop, to prevent potential threats to infiltrate through cross-layer gaps and to reduce the magnitude of their impact. We propose a semantic framework that supports the collaboration between different actors in the production process, to improve situation awareness for cyberthreats prevention. Stakeholders with different expertise are contributing to vulnerability assessment, which can be further combined with attack-scenario analysis to provide more practical analysis. In doing so, we show through a case study evaluation how our proposed framework leverages crucial relationships between vulnerabilities, threats and attacks, in order to narrow further the risk-window induced by discoverable vulnerabilities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Different technologies are used to manage the integration of smart devices with the conventional power grid. This new integration allows more control and monitoring capabilities for stakeholders and customers. However, it also makes the smart grid susceptible to new classes of cyber-physical threats that have to be analysed, evaluated and mitigated. In this paper, we evaluate the risk of manipulating circuit breakers that connect a power generator to the smart grid. Our main contribution is performing risk assessment of the grid by combining the vulnerabilities of its cyber domain and the transient stability analysis of its physical domain. First, we estimate the probability of compromising the energy control centre (ECC) using a Bayesian network. The ECC can be exploited to manipulate circuit breakers. Second, we analyse the impact of manipulating circuit breakers in the IEEE 39-bus test system. Third, the probability of compromise and its impact are combined to quantify risk. Finally, we analyse the effect of integrating photovoltaic (PV) systems on the stability of the smart grid under the same attack scenarios. The results indicate that integrating smart grids with PV systems can improve resilience even if a cyber-attack succeeds. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) are vulnerable to radio frequency (RF) cyber-attacks. Besides, CIED communicate with medical equipment whose telemetry capabilities and IP connectivity are creating new entry points that may be used by attackers. Therefore, it remains crucial to perform a cybersecurity risk assessment of CIED and the systems they rely on to determine the gravity of threats, address the riskiest ones on a priority basis, and develop effective risk management plans. In this study, we carry out such risk assessment according to the ISO/IEC 27005 standard and the NIST SP 800-30 guide. We employed a threat-oriented analytical approach and divided the analysis into three parts, an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks, a scenario-based analysis to measure the probability of occurrence of threats, and a combined analysis to identify the riskiest attack outcomes. The results show that vulnerabilities on the RF interface of CIED represent an acceptable risk, whereas the network and Internet connectivity of the systems they rely on represent an important potential risk. Further analysis reveals that the damages of these cyber-attacks could spread further to affect manufacturers through intellectual property theft or physicians by affecting their reputation. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Subjective judgements from experts provide essential information when assessing and modelling threats in respect to cyber-physical systems. For example, the vulnerability of individual system components can be described using multiple factors, such as complexity, technological maturity, and the availability of tools to aid an attack. Such information is useful for determining attack risk, but much of it is challenging to acquire automatically and instead must be collected through expert assessments. However, most experts inherently carry some degree of uncertainty in their assessments. For example, it is impossible to be certain precisely how many tools are available to aid an attack. Traditional methods of capturing subjective judgements through choices such as high, medium or low do not enable experts to quantify their uncertainty. However, it is important to measure the range of uncertainty surrounding responses in order to appropriately inform system vulnerability analysis. We use a recently introduced interval-valued response-format to capture uncertainty in experts’ judgements and employ inferential statistical approaches to analyse the data. We identify key attributes that contribute to hop vulnerability in cyber-systems and demonstrate the value of capturing the uncertainty around these attributes. We find that this uncertainty is not only predictive of uncertainty in the overall vulnerability of a given system component, but also significantly informs ratings of overall component vulnerability itself. We propose that these methods and associated insights can be employed in real world situations, including vulnerability assessments of cyber-physical systems, which are becoming increasingly complex and integrated into society, making them particularly susceptible to uncertainty in assessment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are vulnerable to network attacks because communication relies on the network that links the various components in the CPS. The importance of network security is self-evident. In this study, we conduct a network security risk assessment from the perspectives of the host and the network, and we propose a new framework for a multidimensional network security risk assessment that includes two stages, i.e., risk identification and risk calculation. For the risk identification stage, we propose a multidimensional hierarchical index system for assessing cybersecurity risk; the system's security status is determined in three dimensions, i.e., basic operation, vulnerabilities, and threats, and these dimensions guide the data collection. In the risk calculation stage, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to assess the network security risk. We provide a new definition of the quality of alert and optimize the observation sequence of the HMM. The model uses a learning algorithm instead of setting the parameters manually. We introduce the concept of network node association to increase the reliability and accuracy of the risk assessment. The simulation results show that the proposed index system provides quantitative data that reflect the security status of the network. The proposed network security risk assessment method based on the improved HMM (I-HMM) reflects the security risk status in a timely and intuitive manner and detects the degree of risk that different hosts pose to the network. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the process of using tools and information to passively learn enough information about an organization to begin the cyber attack cycle. OSINT gathering is often the first step in a malicious cyber campaign. Social Media and the Internet (e.g., search engines, open source tools, blogs) are quickly becoming invaluable sources of information for malicious cyber actors. These two very popular forms of technology are notorious for inherently accumulating and archiving personal information about people, organizations, and networks. These technologies also give information perpetual life, which can be summoned at any time by those in possession of the right knowledge (i.e., Data Science) and tools to extract this information. We posit that the extent of these privacy violations have increased to the point where OSINT identified vulnerabilities may be as useful to attackers as zero-day vulnerabilities, since organizations are likely just as unaware of their presence. We refer to the tools and techniques used to identify these types of vulnerabilities as privacy violating OSINT (PV-OSINT). In this paper, we bring to light the very serious damage that can be done to critical infrastructure (CI), by the use of PV-OSINT. We tested our methodology with a real CI, we then shared our findings with the CI owner to verify the efficacy of our approach. Then we developed a framework that could be used by CI owners to constantly assess the security of their networks using PV-OSINT. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={As cybersecurity (CS) threats become more sophisticated and diversified, organizations are urged to constantly adopt and update measures for contrasting different types of attacks. Particularly, as novel techniques (e.g., social engineering and phishing) are aimed at leveraging individual users’ vulnerabilities to attack and breach a larger system or an entire company, user awareness and behavior have become key factors in preventing adverse events, mitigating their damage, and responding appropriately. As a result, the concept of Cyber Hygiene (CH) is becoming increasingly relevant to address the risk associated to an individual’s CS practices. Consequently, self-assessment tools are becoming more important for evaluating user’s literacy, implementing measures (e.g., training), and studying the effectiveness of interventions. In this paper, we propose a framework for including human factors in the design of self-assessment tools and for accurately modeling CH aspects that the root cause in CS issues. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Payments critical infrastructure is subject to rapid technological change. Increasingly sophisticated threats must be addressed to ensure the banking and financial system security and integrity. Several high-profile cyber-incidents have recently shaken the global financial community and stimulated renewed efforts to reinforce and bolster its security framework. Two different cross border payments management approaches have emerged over the years: the SWIFT financial messaging standard and the innovative peer-to-peer transaction model based on the blockchain technology. Debates about which one will prevail as the best practice are currently a very popular topic. Security, and more specifically resiliency to evolving cyber threats, will likely be the main point of concern. Both the SWIFT and the blockchain models present potential exposure to such vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the discussion boils down to an assessment of whether a decentralized, distributed system like the blockchain better meets the integrity requirements of a modern payments infrastructure and is more suitable to mitigate the root cause of cyber incidents, which is human error. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={One of the most important components constructing the information security management system is the risk assessment process. Information technology system risks have a direct impact on the mission of organisations. Risk assessment allows organisations to identify weaknesses and security threats, and adopt appropriate solutions to deal with risks. The risk identification and assessment is the most important and complex part of the risk management process. In this study, a method has been presented to asset technical risks with regard to the sensitivity of each of the assets. In this research, the cyber battlefield framework has been presented to analyse the assets' sensitivity and then to determine the risk of each. The cyber battlefield contains exact information about cyber environment, including a vulnerability of knowledge repository, tangible and intangible components of cyber environment, and the relationships between them. Cyber-attacks are performed using vulnerabilities in the cyber environment components, so the present study focuses on the provision of a method to determine the risk due to the vulnerabilities. Considering the cost of risks treatment, the risks have been prioritised. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019},

abstract={Emerging trends that are shaping the future of the automotive industry include electrification, autonomous driving, sharing, and connectivity, and these trends keep changing annually. Thus, the automotive industry is shifting from mechanical devices to electronic control devices, and is not moving to Internet of Things devices connected to 5G networks. Owing to the convergence of automobile-information and communication technology (ICT), the safety and convenience features of automobiles have improved significantly. However, cyberattacks that occur in the existing ICT environment and can occur in the upcoming 5G network are being replicated in the automobile environment. In a hyper-connected society where 5G networks are commercially available, automotive security is extremely important, as vehicles become the center of vehicle to everything (V2X) communication connected to everything around them. Designing, developing, and deploying information security techniques for vehicles require a systematic security-risk-assessment and management process throughout the vehicle's lifecycle. To do this, a security risk analysis (SRA) must be performed, which requires an analysis of cyber threats on automotive vehicles. In this study, we introduce a cyber kill chain-based cyberattack analysis method to create a formal vulnerability-analysis system. We can also analyze car-hacking studies that were conducted on real cars to identify the characteristics of the attack stages of existing car-hacking techniques and propose the minimum but essential measures for defense. Finally, we propose an automotive common-vulnerabilities-and-exposure system to manage and share evolving vehicle-related cyberattacks, threats, and vulnerabilities. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increasing growth of cyber-attack incidences, it is important to develop innovative and effective techniques to assess and defend networked systems against cyber attacks. One of the well-known techniques for this is performing penetration testing which is carried by a group of security professionals (i.e, red team). Penetration testing is also known to be effective to find existing and new vulnerabilities, however, the quality of security assessment can be depending on the quality of the red team members and their time and devotion to the penetration testing. In this paper, we propose a novel automation framework for cyber-attacks generation named 'HARMer' to address the challenges with respect to manual attack execution by the red team. Our novel proposed framework, design, and implementation is based on a scalable graphical security model called Hierarchical Attack Representation Model (HARM). (1) We propose the requirements and the key phases for the automation framework. (2) We propose security metrics-based attack planning strategies along with their algorithms. (3) We conduct experiments in a real enterprise network and Amazon Web Services. The results show how the different phases of the framework interact to model the attackers' operations. This framework will allow security administrators to automatically assess the impact of various threats and attacks in an automated manner. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Research and development of autonomous ships is progressing rapidly and involves all relevant stakeholders' contributions. DNV GL as a classification society is obligated to develop new maritime rules and guidelines aiming to ensure safe, secure and efficient future maritime operations. We need to understand new challenges and assess new risks arising from the development and operations of such ships. Autonomous ships are complex safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS) of which safety and security are two crucial properties. It is imperative to identity inter-dependencies between safety and security for thoroughly assessing and managing potential risks. Therefore, we need a systematic framework with concrete execution steps to perform a combined safety and security co-analysis. The System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is primarily developed for safety analysis of systems which can be depicted using well defined control system designs. However, the STPA needs to be improved to properly analyze autonomous ships which typically integrate emerging technologies and define novel functionalities. This paper explores the feasibility of applying an STPA safety and security co-analysis on novel CPS. We identify a gap existing between the first two steps in basic STPA, i.e., it is not straightforward to model the control structure(s) (in Step 2) from the system engineering foundation established in Step 1, with limited prior knowledge. Our first contribution is to bridge this gap by extending the analysis of Step 1. More specifically, functional requirements derived from safety (or security) constraints are used to facilitate the modeling of control structures. The STPA safety and security co-analysis has been studied to assess the risks of CPS collectively. However, to the best of our knowledge, not too much work focusing on how to tightly incorporate conventional security analysis techniques into the STPA analysis process has been performed. Our second contribution is to improve the current STPA-Sec by appropriately integrating widely adopted security analysis methods into the analysis process. A comprehensive list of vulnerabilities and threats can be identified through the improved analysis process and specific security requirements are derived accordingly. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

abstract={Availability and easy access to sophisticated cyber penetration testing tools enable exploitation of vulnerabilities in different systems globally. Repetitive nature and recognisable signatures of attacks raise demand for effective information sharing. Timely warnings about cyber incidents in other systems make it possible to identify related attacks locally. International cyber community supports several commercial and open-source threat information sharing platforms. Efficient use of these systems depends both on the quality of submitted information and the ability of the security specialist to receive, interpret, and integrate indicators of compromise into local defence systems. Business stakeholders tend to emphasise the importance of threat hunters, while the information-sharing aspect is overlooked. Therefore, there is a need for professionals who can assess risk levels of cyber incidents in a broad context and share concise information with team members, superiors, relevant institutions, and community. The complex nature of cyber attacks raised the popularity of live cyber defence exercises (CDX), where cybersecurity specialists are trained using simulated real-life scenarios. However, the exercises are mostly oriented towards the development of technical competences. This paper addresses the problem of proper development of information sharing competence during the CDX. We performed a case study of two annual international CDX. Research data were collected using several techniques. First, the participants filled in pre-event and post-event questionnaires. Additionally, each defending team was continuously observed by a dedicated evaluation team member. Finally, incident reports in short and long forms were gathered. We distinguished challenges related to internal team collaboration, information sharing among the teams, and reporting to relevant authorities. Based on the findings, we present a methodology to integrate information sharing into the planning and execution of CDX. The methodology encompasses activities, scoring strategies, scenario recommendations, tools, and communication-encouragement components. The presented enhancement creates an observable added value to the CDX training event. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The expansion of information technology infrastructure is encountered with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), which can launch data destruction, disclosure, modification, and/or Denial of Service attacks by drawing upon vulnerabilities of software and hardware. Moving Target Defense (MTD) is a promising risk mitigation technique that replies to APTs via implementing randomisation and dynamic strategies on compromised assets. However, some MTD techniques adopt the blind random mutation, which causes greater performance overhead and worse defense utility. In this paper, we formulate the cyber-attack and defense as a dynamic partially observable Markov process based on dynamic Bayesian inference. Then we develop an Inference-Based Adaptive Attack Tolerance (IBAAT) system, which includes two stages. In the first stage, a forward–backward algorithm with a time window is employed to perform a security risk assessment. To select the defense strategy, in the second stage, the attack and defense process is modelled as a two-player general-sum Markov game and the optimal defense strategy is acquired by quantitative analysis based on the first stage. The evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm has about 10% security utility improvement compared to the state-of-the-art. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Risk assessors and managers face many difficult challenges related to novel cyber systems. Among these challenges are the constantly changing nature of cyber systems caused by technical advances, their distribution across the physical, information, and sociocognitive domains, and the complex network structures often including thousands of nodes. Here, we review probabilistic and risk-based decision-making techniques applied to cyber systems and conclude that existing approaches typically do not address all components of the risk assessment triplet (threat, vulnerability, consequence) and lack the ability to integrate across multiple domains of cyber systems to provide guidance for enhancing cybersecurity. We present a decision-analysis-based approach that quantifies threat, vulnerability, and consequences through a set of criteria designed to assess the overall utility of cybersecurity management alternatives. The proposed framework bridges the gap between risk assessment and risk management, allowing an analyst to ensure a structured and transparent process of selecting risk management alternatives. The use of this technique is illustrated for a hypothetical, but realistic, case study exemplifying the process of evaluating and ranking five cybersecurity enhancement strategies. The approach presented does not necessarily eliminate biases and subjectivity necessary for selecting countermeasures, but provides justifiable methods for selecting risk management actions consistent with stakeholder and decisionmaker values and technical data.

abstract={The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) enabled a new class of connected, smart, and interactive devices. With their continuous connectivity and their access to valuable information in both the digital and physical world, they are highly attractive targets for security attackers. Integrating them into the industry and our daily used devices adds new attack surfaces. These potential threats call for special care of security vulnerabilities during the design of IoT devices and CPS. Due to their resource-constrained nature, designing secure IoT devices and CPS poses a complex task, considering the selectable hardware components and task implementation alternatives. Researchers proposed a range of automatic design tools to support system designers in their task of finding the optimal hardware selection and task implementations. Said tools offer a limited way of modeling attack scenarios for a system under design. The framework proposed in this paper aims at closing this gap, offering system designers a way to consider security attacks and security risks during the early phase of system design. It offers designers the possibility to model security constraints from the view of potential attackers, assessing the probability of successful security attacks and the resulting security risk, alike. We demonstrate the framework’s feasibility and performance by revisiting an industry partner’s potential system design of a future IoT device. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper describes a systemic method towards standardization of a cyber weapon effectiveness and effectiveness prediction process to promote consistency and improve cyber weapon system evaluation accuracy - for both offensive and defensive postures. The approach included theoretical examination of existing effectiveness prediction processes for kinetic and directed energy weapons, complemented with technical and social aspects of cyber realm. The examination highlighted several paradigm-shifts needed to transition from purely kinetic-based processes and transition into the realm of combined kinetic and cyber weapons. Components of the new method for cyber weapons are cyber payload assessment, effects identification, and target assessment. The ultimate outcome of method is the 'Probability of Kill' for a cyber weapon paired with a threat and within a given situation. This probability is a function of factors such as intelligence gathered on the latency of information, access points, hardware and software configurations, accuracy and completeness of network map, understanding of operations tempo; likelihood that vulnerabilities being exploited are patched and IT's ability to detect and respond to the delivery of the cyber payload; and probability that the payload will achieve the desired mission effects. Aside from the use of this method for offensive purposes, it can also be mirrored as cyber defense and can serve as basis for developing cyber defense strategies, such as focused counter intelligence on access points, hardware and software configurations, and network map and architecture, comprehensive patching to assure most current and complete patches are deployed, and well trained and equipped IT with ability to detect and respond to cyber payloads. © 2020. the authors.

abstract={The Executive Order 13800—Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure—issued by the President of the United States, calls for an evaluation of the “readiness and gaps in the United States’ ability to manage and mitigate consequences of a cyber incident against the electricity subsector.” In May of 2018, the Office of Management and Budget finished evaluating the 96 risk assessments conducted by various agencies and published Federal Cybersecurity Risk Determination Report and Action Plan (Risk Report). While the report embraced a broad defending forward strategy, it made no reference to smart grids or their vulnerable intelligent substations and did not address how federal agencies plan to respond to emerging threats to these systems. While the paper does not discuss how to attack the smart grids in the cyber domain, the contribution to the academic debate lies in validating some of the vulnerabilities of the grid’s substations in order for government, private industry, academia, and civil society to better collaborate in disrupting or halting malicious cyber activities before they disrupt the power supply of the United States and its Transatlantic allies. We also discuss how Artificial Intelligence and related techniques can mitigate security risks to cyber-physical systems. Until this technology becomes available, however, standardization of cyber security efforts must be enforced through regulatory means, such as the enforcement of security-by-design Intelligent Electronic Devices and protocols for the smart grid. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

abstract={DNA fingerprinting can offer remarkable benefits, especially for point-of-care diagnostics, information forensics, and analysis. However, the pressure to drive down costs is likely to lead to cheap untrusted solutions and a multitude of unprecedented risks. These risks will especially emerge at the frontier between the cyberspace and DNA biology. To address these risks, we perform a forensic-security assessment of a typical DNA-fingerprinting flow. We demonstrate, for the first time, benchtop analysis of biochemical-level vulnerabilities in flows that are based on a standard quantification assay known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After identifying potential vulnerabilities, we realize attacks using benchtop techniques to demonstrate their catastrophic impact on the outcome of the DNA fingerprinting. We also propose a countermeasure, in which DNA samples are each uniquely barcoded (using synthesized DNA molecules) in advance of PCR analysis, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our approach using benchtop techniques. We discuss how molecular barcoding could be utilized within a cyber-biological framework to improve DNA-fingerprinting security against a wide range of threats, including sample forgery. We also present a security analysis of the DNA barcoding mechanism from a molecular biology perspective. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With the exponentially increasing use of online tools, applications that are being made for day to day purpose by small and large industries, the threat of exploitation is also increasing. Remote Code Execution (RCE) is one of the topmost critical and serious web applications vulnerability of this era and one of the major concerns among cyber threats, which can exploit web servers through their functionalities and usingtheir scripts/files. RCE is an application layer vulnerability caused by careless coding practice which leads to a huge security breach that may bring unwanted resource loss or damages. An attacker may execute malicious code and take complete control of the targeted system with the privileges of an authentic user with this vulnerability. Attackers can attempt to advance their privileges after gaining access to the system. Remote Code Execution can lead to a full compromise of the vulnerable web application as well as the web server. This chapter highlights the concern and risk needed to put under consideration caused by RCE vulnerability of a system. Moreover, this study and its findings will help application developers and its stakeholders to understand the risk of data compromise and unauthorized access to the system. An exploitation algorithm is proposed to identify RCE vulnerability in web application. Then based on it, around 1011 web applications were taken under consideration and experiments were conducted by following manual double blinded penetration testing strategy. The experiments show that more than 12% of web application were found vulnerable to RCE. This study also explicitly listed the critical factors of Remote Code Execution vulnerability and improper input handling. The experimental results are promising to motivate developers to focus on security enhancement through proper and safe input handling. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Protection of the state's critical information infrastructure is a complex process, which requires effective tools for entities' identification, assessing their criticality, threat and vulnerability assessment, protection against threats and also determining the cybersecurity level of the individual entities, industries, regions, and countries. The conducted analysis is shown that today there is no complex, multifunctional method which helps to evaluate the cybersecurity level of the critical information infrastructure entity or a certain industry of the state. With that in mind, in this paper the method of determining the cybersecurity level of the state's critical information infrastructure was developed, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of the known approaches. The method will be useful for CSIRT groups (or any other parties, who is responsible for cybersecurity in organization) to analyze a particular industry and evaluate its cybersecurity level. The developed method allows to calculate quantitative parameters, describing the analyzed sector, also to compare the security level of the critical entity before and after implementation of certain security measures. For example, the usage of the mentioned method in the civil aviation was shown but it can be used in various critical infrastructure sectors. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

abstract={The Chief Financial Officer's (CFOs) role is changing in all domains, especially where cybersecurity is concerned. It is no longer the sole responsibility of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) to ensure which and how cybersecurity measures are implemented. The CFO has a unique enterprise-wide view and can thus play a critical role in ensuring that an organization's enterprise resource planning (ERP) and financial-related system infrastructure are relevant, modernized, and safeguarded. The CFO can quantify its agency's performance, particularly by focusing on budget execution and financial reporting and not on cybersecurity, and subsequently, create a vulnerability. Due to the amount of cyberattacks negatively impacting all levels of government and the public sector, operational costs to cover cybersecurity efforts are significantly rising. In many cases, this is often due to an organization being reactive instead of proactive in its measures. Consequently, the role of the 'next generation' CFO must be enhanced and supported by other senior-level leaders. From an operational perspective, the CFO must know where information is located; how it is stored and secured; and who has the appropriate level of security to access it. Hence, the CFO must be embraced and incorporated as a full-fledged participant in cyber efforts, as well as be an architect of the organization's cybersecurity strategy. The CFO will need access to reports that highlight cybercrimes and attacks to varied information technology (IT) infrastructure. In addition, the CFO needs to know how information is targeted and used; the level of risk and impact to potential targets; technique(s) used to perform the cyberattack; have an understanding of cyber insurance and whether it is relevant and appropriate to the organization's needs; and establish a risk management framework to identify, prioritize, and assess risks that threaten cybersecurity. Although positive gains have been made within the CFO community towards cybersecurity efforts, a significant amount of work is still required to realize success in the reduction of threats to cybersecurity. This study will focus on the need to expand the role of the CFO in cybersecurity efforts and the actions the CFO must promote to reduce the organization's cybersecurity vulnerabilities. © 2020. the authors.

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) play an important role in today's industry by providing process automation, distributed control, and process monitoring. ICS was designed to be used in an isolated area or connected to other systems via specialised communication mechanisms or protocols. This setup allows manufacturers to manage their production processes with great flexibility and safety. However, this design does not meet today's business requirements to work with state-of-the-art technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) and big data analytics. In order to fulfil industry requirements, many ICSs have been connected to enterprise networks that allow business users to access real-time data generated by power plants. At the same time, this new design opens up several cybersecurity challenges for ICSs. We review possible cyber attacks on ICSs, identify typical threats and vulnerabilities, and we discuss unresolved security issues with existing ICS cybersecurity solutions. Then, we discuss how to secure ICSs (e.g., using risk assessment methodologies) and other protection measures. We also identify open security research challenges for ICSs, and we present a classification of existing security solutions along with their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we provide future research directions in ICS security. © 2019},

abstract={This document presents an introduction to the events that occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean, where banks are compromised by cyber-attacks, the same case is also seen in Ecuador, where losses from these attacks would amount to $ 6 billion by 2021. Our goal is to provide an analysis that demonstrates the social impact that cybersecurity has in Latin America and the Caribbean and a way to measure cybersecurity to combat threats due to constant technological progress and the great privacy risks presented to the day with cyber systems. The deductive method was used, adopting and generating a set of activities to evaluate the Total Cybersecurity (TC) of the cyber systems and/or companies to have a control of the security that it has and the improvements that can be implemented to prevent or combat Possible cyber threats or vulnerabilities. It resulted in cyber-resilience activities and activities based on the main functions before, during and after a cyber-attack. These activities are evaluated by the frequency of use, allowing each activity to assign a value and in this way apply the formulas proposed and obtain the CT, achieving the percentage of cybersecurity that has been implemented and discovering the weaknesses of the systems that They must be strengthened. It was concluded that in certain countries of Latin America and the Caribbean they have very little interest in the development and expansion of cybersecurity in their lands, unlike the progress of cybersecurity in European countries. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={One of the most important goals in an organization is to have risks under an acceptance level along the time. All organizations are exposed to real-time security threats that could have an impact on their risk exposure levels harming the entire organization, their customers and their reputation. New emerging techniques, tactics and procedures (TTP) which remain undetected, the complexity and decentralization of organization assets, the great number of vulnerabilities proportional to the number of new type of devices (IoT) or still the high number of false positives, are only some examples of real risks for any organization. Risk management frameworks are not integrated and automated with near real-time (NRT) risk-related cybersecurity threat intelligence (CTI) information. The contribution of this paper is an integrated architecture based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL), a semantic reasoner and the use of Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to approach a Dynamic Risk Assessment and Management (DRA/DRM) framework at all levels (operational, tactic and strategic). To enable such a dynamic, NRT and more realistic risk assessment and management processes, we created a new semantic version of STIX™v2.0 for cyber threat intelligence as it is becoming a de facto standard for structured threat information exchange. We selected an international leading organization in cybersecurity to demonstrate new dynamic ways to support decision making at all levels while being under attack. Semantic reasoners could be our ideal partners to fight against threats having risks under control along the time, for that, they need to understand the data. Our proposal uses an unprecedented mix of standards to cover all levels of a DRM and ensure easier adoption by users. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={yber Physical Systems (CPS) are emerging as a current research discipline at the convergence of physical, biological, engineering and data sciences. As technology evolves, Cyber Physical Systems become vulnerable to a wider spectrum of threats. Addressing these threats require the need for novel solutions for protecting critical infrastructure. However, there are two distinct challenges faced by researchers from cross-disciplinary fields such as energy systems, data science, and cyber security. First, there are lack of experimental platforms integrating industry-standard hardware, software and protocols. This impedes the research of conducting cybersecurity study on CPS including vulnerabilities connected with CPS parts and modeling their corresponding impact. Second, the absence of systematic labelled data along with other information relevant to the model poses hazards to the growth and assessment of data mining algorithms that can classify CPS cyber threats. Therefore, an experimental platform is required to model attacks and understand their impact on system operations and end-users and further develop analytics based security solutions to mitigate them. In this paper, we develop a cyber physical testbed using NS-3 network simulator in conjunction with Raspberry Pi acting as a proxy for CPS hardware components. In addition, we model a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), a potential cyber threat in CPS using NS-3. Finally, we develop an anomaly detection system using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that uses network layer parameters to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviour. Evaluation shows that our proposed system achieves an accuracy of 98.32%. Cyber Physical, ANN, NS-3, Raspberry Pi © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) are assets that provide core functions to modern society, which failure or incapacitation can adversely affect national security, economic prosperity and wellbeing of citizens. In an evolving digital society, CNI rely heavily on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure to improve productivity, and effectively deliver critical services in timely and cost-effective fashion. However, the underlying ICT infrastructure that drives CNI amplify cyber risks, threats and vulnerabilities exponentially. Consequently, a failure in ICT infrastructure has the potential to affect CNI in an unexpected manner. The risks associated with the use of ICT are dynamic, raising the need for continuous assessment of degree of ICT dependency. Presently however, there is rarely a framework nor a publicly available tool in Nigeria that can quantitatively gauge the degree of CNI dependency on ICT. The study addresses this gap by the development of a conceptual framework that can facilitate the assessment of the degree of CNI dependency on ICT. In this study, existing relevant documents on critical infrastructure, ICT frameworks and standards and critical process engineering principles were scanned, analysed and synthesised to conceptualise the framework, and the construction of the building blocks, metrics and indicators. The framework was tested using a hypothetical discrete dataset. The outcome further facilitated the framing of ICT Dependency Index (IDI), a predefined quadrant, of which the computation of Dependency must fall within one of the quadrants. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The omnipresence of smart devices in many aspects of modern everyday life has helped to achieve an enormous level of automation, has ensured sustainable development, and improved quality of life. Over the last decade, such small and portable devices became cheap and easy to deploy in any kind of application. With the full range of versatile connectivity, such technological development also brings multiple challenges related to the security of infrastructure and data. Many individuals, companies, and states worldwide experience the previously unseen scale and scope of the attacks using novel approaches. All these smart applications have also increased the overall attack surface leading to multiple attack vectors available through vulnerabilities. Lack of standards, insufficient security awareness, and new technological landscape does not help either. Considering this, one needs to enhance forensics investigation methodologies, employ novel tools, combine threat intelligence, and integrate forensic readiness. Such measures will help to reduce the total cyber risk through a high level of preparedness for anticipated data-driven crimes in smart applications. We believe that this paper will help in bringing novel focus to existing digital forensics methodologies with a focus on smart applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, the growing emergence of digitalization and data explosion has altered the threat dynamics in the maritime sector. The interconnected Maritime Critical Infrastructures are highly attracted by cybercriminals, who are constantly evolving their tactics, committing complex, sophisticated attacks causing a tremendous impact to economic and social life. Such intrusions engage multi-vector, composite attacks exploiting existing vulnerabilities from both the physical and the cyber domain. Current risk assessment approaches and countermeasure strategies fail to gather an overview of the maritime physical and cyber threat landscape. This work describes a method to detect and counter such sophisticated attacks by applying a Hybrid Situational Awareness model. This model allows to generate a holistic picture of the security condition within Maritime Critical Infrastructures considering the potential cascading effects of such combined cyberphysical attacks. Furthermore, the current work presents some illustrative examples, which show how the Hybrid Situational Awareness model can be integrated into maritime environments to detect potential future coordinated attacks and how it can facilitate the communication with first responders and emergency organizations of a city in case of a crisis. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber security risk assessment of control system power plant control systems often has strong subjective and uncertainty problems, and these issues will have a certain impact on the assessment results. To solve this problem, a method of information security risk assessment of power plant control systems based on the D-AHP and the TOPSIS is proposed. According to the relevant industry standards for risk assessment of industrial control systems, assets, threats, vulnerabilities and existing safety measures of industrial control systems are identified, and the assessment index system and a hierarchical structure model are established. Aiming at the uncertainty of assessment information caused by the differencesin expert's experience, the D-AHP is used to solve the impact weights of each index. Then the TOPSIS is used to find the expert weight. Finally, the information security risk value of the control system for power plants is obtained. Example analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed method and the better accuracy of assessment results. © 2019, Editorial Office of Control and Decision. All right reserved.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of the number of connected devices on the internet, a significant increase in internet and network applications in the last decade led to the appearance of function-based networks called the Internet of Things (IoT). Such interest and dependency come with exponentially increasing security threats. Those threats are very dynamic, and change continuously despite the fact that IoT devices may not go through the same speed for security fixes, updates, etc. As a result, research trends focus on utilizing data analytics to build intelligence and autonomous mechanisms to enable IoT systems to respond to threats in real time. To this end, our project goal is to evaluate methods to build fast and efficient intrusion detection systems (IDS) that meet the high scalability and dynamicity of IoT environments.In this research, we studied three different datasets used to represent IoT network traffic and used them as a benchmark to evaluate many IDSs' performances. Results showed that features' quality has an impact on classification models and thus IDS performance. Our results showed also that the optimum time-window of an IDS preferred to be long (decay factor 0.01 or 0.1) when evaluating the BotNet-IoT dataset. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This perspectives article addresses risk in cyber defense and identifies opportunities to incorporate risk analysis principles into the cybersecurity field. The Science of Security (SoS) initiative at the National Security Agency seeks to further and promote interdisciplinary research in cybersecurity. SoS organizes its research into the Five Hard Problems (5HP): (1) scalability and composability; (2) policy-governed secure collaboration; (3) security-metrics–driven evaluation, design, development, and deployment; (4) resilient architectures; and (5) understanding and accounting for human behavior. However, a vast majority of the research sponsored by SoS does not consider risk and when it does so, only implicitly. Therefore, we identify opportunities for risk analysis in each hard problem and propose approaches to address these objectives. Such collaborations between risk and cybersecurity researchers will enable growth and insight in both fields, as risk analysts may apply existing methodology in a new realm, while the cybersecurity community benefits from accepted practices for describing, quantifying, working with, and mitigating risk. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis},

abstract={Modern ICT ecosystems such as healthcare environments (hospitals, care-centers etc.), operate in different abstraction layers (cloud, fog, extreme-edge) and comprise large numbers of network entities such as terminals, devices, sensors or even specialized appliances (virtual or physical). It is common in such environments, that several network entities with intermittent connectivity, join and leave the network in an unstructured and unsupervised manner (Wi-Fi access-points, BYOD policies, IoT, etc.). Such devices of frivolous nature, or even trusted devices/terminals, are prone to security vulnerabilities, since they are operated by regular, non-expert users who are not aware of any security aspects whatsoever. To effectively manage and proactively protect such large, complex and multilayered networks, dedicated personnel (system administrators, security specialists etc.) must be employed and specialized appliances must be deployed. On the other hand, modern cyber-warfare has become even more elaborate and insightful. Thus, ICT infrastructures must continuously evolve and adapt to the everchanging cyber-threats, which is a rather cumbersome and expensive task to accomplish. Towards addressing the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a cross-layered system, which leverages the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm and the distributed Fog architecture, for network slicing and task offloading to provide dynamic, security-aware Vulnerability-Assessment as a service for large ICT infrastructures. The presented system provides seamless assessment for all existing and newly introduced network entities against all known security vulnerabilities, certifies them through a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), classifies them according to the cyber-threat they introduce, and finally assigns them to a connectivity-appropriate VLAN. The presented system was preliminarily evaluated under a controlled-conditions simulation environment. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In this paper, we present a framework for assessing cyber risks that affect safe operation of ships. The framework relies on an on-board survey to identify existing safeguards, cyber security testing to detect vulnerabilities and threats, and determination of the cyber risk level. The cyber security testing of the ship’s critical systems and assets, as the specific part of the framework, is introduced and studied. The cyber security testing method is based on computational vulnerability scanning and penetration testing techniques, which is aligned with the upcoming maritime standard IEC 63154.

abstract={In December 2015, a cyber-physical attack took place on the Ukrainian electricity distribution network. This is regarded as one of the first cyber-physical attacks on electricity infrastructure to have led to a substantial power outage and is illustrative of the increasing vulnerability of Critical National Infrastructure to this type of malicious activity. Few data points, coupled with the rapid emergence of cyber phenomena, has held back the development of resilience analytics of cyber-physical attacks, relative to many other threats. We propose to overcome data limitations by applying stochastic counterfactual risk analysis as part of a new vulnerability assessment framework. The method is developed in the context of the direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts of a Ukrainian-style cyber-physical attack taking place on the electricity distribution network serving London and its surrounding regions. A key finding is that if decision-makers wish to mitigate major population disruptions, then they must invest resources more-or-less equally across all substations, to prevent the scaling of a cyber-physical attack. However, there are some substations associated with higher economic value due to their support of other Critical National Infrastructures assets, which justifies the allocation of additional cyber security investment to reduce the chance of cascading failure. Further cyber-physical vulnerability research must address the tradeoffs inherent in a system made up of multiple institutions with different strategic risk mitigation objectives and metrics of value, such as governments, infrastructure operators, and commercial consumers of infrastructure services. © 2019 The Authors Risk Analysis published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract={In enterprise environments, the amount of managed assets and vulnerabilities that can be exploited is staggering.

In this vision paper, we enumerate risk-reduction security requirements in large scale environments, then present the Agile Security methodology and technologies for detection, modeling, and constant prioritization of security requirements, agile style. Agile Security models different types of security requirements into the context of an attack graph, containing business process targets and critical assets identification, configuration items, and possible impacts of cyber-attacks. By simulating and analyzing virtual adversary attack paths toward cardinal assets, Agile Security examines the business impact on business processes and prioritizes surgical requirements. Thus, handling these requirements backlog that are constantly evaluated as an outcome of employing Agile Security, gradually increases system hardening, reduces business risks and informs the IT service desk or Security Operation Center what remediation action to perform next. Once remediated, Agile Security constantly recomputes residual risk, assessing risk increase by threat intelligence or infrastructure changes versus defender's remediation actions in order to drive overall attack surface reduction. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent examples driving an increased need for cyber awareness include unmanned aerial vehicles (DAVs) in the airspace, development of the Automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B), and the risk of cyber intrusion. The incident of a civilian UAV disrupting a major airport, is one example of many incidents raising questions on the future of airspace security. While a civilian hobbyist might be ignorant of the impending harm, the situation could pose a threat to the air operations. Using this incident and others like it, ideas on the future trends in cyber awareness applied to avionics are considered. Three general ideas are incorporated: (1) mandates for new rules for airspace restrictions (e.g., geofence), (2) advanced display analytics to support the airport staff and pilots with visual displays, such as collision avoidance, and (3) electronics to support the mitigation of electronic cyber effects posed by the obtrusive aircraft. With a variety of opinions posed, the summary is intended to foster a discussion on research, industry, and commercial directions for the avionics community to consider with respect to cyber awareness. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Insufficient authentication and authorization of interconnected components are major risks in the Industrial Control System (ICS). To address this, we introduce CyRA, a realtime risk-based security assessment framework that consists of a Nested-ICS security architecture, secure registration protocol, and risk-based multi-factor authentication protocol by which every component is authenticated and authorized to ensure secure communications and prevent cyber attacks in the ICS. Our proposed framework applies Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (ZKPK) to perform risk-based multi-factor authentication and authorization using a digitally signed identity that encodes secrets provided by the component. Our approach is based on Threat Modeling (TM), Vulnerability Identification (VI), and Consequence Analysis (CA) to provide adequate and efficient authentication and authorization in the ICS. The resilience of our framework is evaluated against recent well-known cyber attacks. Specifically, we conduct a risk-based security assessment for a Safety Instrumentation System (SIS) communication protocol, known as TriStation. The results show that our framework enhances the security of the protocol in dealing with real-time uncertainty of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences from a new cyber-attack, known as TRITON malware. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last decade, the protection of urban infrastructures has become a focus in German security policies. These point not solely to the multiple external infrastructural threats (e.g. natural disasters, terrorist and cyber-attacks), but also to the endogenous risks of cascading failures across geographical and functional borders that arise from interlocking and often mutually dependent infrastructures. As geographical nodes in infrastructurally mediated flows, cities are considered to be particularly vulnerable to infrastructure breakdowns. Their capability to prevent and to prepare for infrastructural failures, and thus to manage infrastructural interdependencies, is seen as a major prerequisite for resilient societies. However, as our article demonstrates, the institutional capacity of the local authorities and utility companies for risk mitigation and preparedness is limited. Drawing on qualitative research in selected German cities, we argue that the governance of critical infrastructures involves considerable challenges: it overarches different, often fragmented, policy domains and territories and institutionally unbundled utility (sub-) domains. Moreover, risk mitigation and preparedness are usually not based on experience from past events, but on destructive scenarios. They involve considerable uncertainty and contestations among local decision-makers. Interviews with local experts indicate that effective governance of critical infrastructures requires more regulatory efforts by national policies. At the same time, they point to the need for identifying and assessing place-based vulnerabilities, for defining locally differentiated mitigation and preparedness strategies and for the training of local utility companies as well as crisis management. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.},

abstract={Nowadays, our society is increasingly becoming economically and socially dependent on the cyberspace. However, the cyberspace is exposed to numerous risks, and there is a constant threat of exploitable vulnerabilities, which could cause significant reputational and economic damages. For addressing these threats, the Italian National Cyber Security Framework was developed to offer an approach to assessing cyber risks into organizations, as well as to help improve the related security through focused investments. Still, this evaluation is not a straightforward endeavour. Using the principles of the Systems Thinking paradigm, this work puts into causal relationships the self-assessment risk-categories by associating them to the various aspects of an organization structure used as a case study (composed of business areas and process). Finally, it presents a systemic causal-effect relationship map capable of evidencing how a change in one or more categories could impact other security-related elements of the company. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid evolution of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services transforms the conventional electrical grid into a new paradigm called Smart Grid (SG). Even though SG brings significant improvements, such as increased reliability and better energy management, it also introduces multiple security challenges. One of the main reasons for this is that SG combines a wide range of heterogeneous technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The latter are responsible for monitoring and controlling the automatic procedures of energy transmission and distribution. Nevertheless, the presence of these systems introduces multiple vulnerabilities because their protocols do not implement essential security mechanisms such as authentication and access control. In this paper, we focus our attention on the security issues of the IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC-104) protocol, which is widely utilized in the European energy sector. In particular, we provide a SCADA threat model based on a Coloured Petri Net (CPN) and emulate four different types of cyber attacks against IEC-104. Last, we used AlienVault's risk assessment model to evaluate the risk level that each of these cyber attacks introduces to our system to confirm our intuition about their severity. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Increasing incorporation of advanced information technologies makes business and public organisations more effective and efficient, while often introducing exploitable vulnerabilities. The efficient provision of security of interconnected, and interdependent, processes and sectors against cyberattacks requires deep understanding of vulnerabilities, exposure, potential negative impact, as well as the contribution existing and emerging organisational and technological solutions will potentially have on preventing attacks, reducing vulnerabilities, protecting digital infrastructures, response and recovery, and resilience. Such understanding will allow minimisation of risks against a spectrum of plausible cyber threats and reducing negative consequences of one or a series of cyberattacks. Due to the complexity of the problem, the effective implementation of a number of functions and tasks in designing and operating distributed cyber secure and resilient systems require significant computational resources. This paper outlines six high-level, computationally demanding functions. The first three relate to the formulation and implementation of cybersecurity policy: understanding risk; planning and implementing cybersecurity measures; and continuous adaptation to the changing technological, threat and policy landscape. The other three functions are operational: situational awareness, including detection of cyberattacks and hybrid malicious activities; operational decision making, e.g. selecting a course of action under attack; and cyber forensics. © 2019 Copyright Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The rapid pace of Electrification in the transportation sector, realized through plug-in electric vehicle (EV) integration, necessitates the smart charging infrastructures. These systems built on real-time data collection and decision making coordinate the charging demand to facilitate high penetration of PEV s in the power grids. Accordingly, the inherent cyber-physical characteristic of smart charging networks makes them susceptible to cyber-physical threats. Due to the lack of a consistent cyber-physical attack assessment in EV networks, this paper aims to propose the vulnerability analysis and risk assessment for the smart charging infrastructures. To this end, we define several potential failure scenarios for the WinSmartEV™ charging system on the UCLA campus and study the impacts of potential cyber-physical attacks. Moreover, we outline a codified methodology and taxonomy for assessing vulnerability and risk of cyber-physical attacks on the EV charging networks in order to create a generalizable and comprehensive solution. The outcome is a framework to prioritize the degree of the vulnerabilities and risks in the EV networks and to develop effective countermeasures. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things is the next-generation Internet network created by intelligent objects with software and sensors, employed in a wide range of fields such as automotive, construction, health, textile, education and transportation. With the advent of Industry 4.0, Internet of Things has been started to be used and it has led to the emergence of innovative business models. The processing and production capabilities of Internet of Things objects in hidden and critical data provide great advantages for the next generation of Internet. However, the integrated features of Internet of Things objects cause vulnerabilities in terms of security, making them the target of cyber threats. In this study, a security model which offers an integrated risk-based Internet of Things security approach for the Internet of Things vulnerabilities while providing detailed information about Internet of Things and the types of attacks targeting Internet of Things is proposed. In addition, in this study, the vulnerabilities of Internet of Things were explained by classifying attack types threatening the physical layer, network layer, data processing layer and application layer. Moreover, the risk-based security model has been proposed by examining the vulnerabilities and threats of smart objects that generate the Internet of Things. The proposed Internet of Things model is a holistic security model that separately evaluates the Internet of Things layers against vulnerabilities and threats based on the risk-level approach. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={The proliferation of technologies embedded in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) increases the potential of cyber-attacks. The communication systems between vehicles and infrastructure present remote attack access for malicious hackers to exploit system vulnerabilities. Increased connectivity combined with autonomous driving functions pose a considerable threat to the vast socioeconomic benefits promised by CAVs. However, the absence of historical information on cyber-attacks mean that traditional risk assessment methods are rendered ineffective. This paper proposes a proactive CAV cyber-risk classification model which overcomes this issue by incorporating known software vulnerabilities contained within the US National Vulnerability Database into model building and testing phases. This method uses a Bayesian Network (BN) model, premised on the variables and causal relationships derived from the Common Vulnerability Scoring Scheme (CVSS), to represent the probabilistic structure and parameterisation of CAV cyber-risk. The resulting BN model is validated with an out-of-sample test demonstrating nearly 100% prediction accuracy of the quantitative risk score and qualitative risk level. The model is then applied to the use-case of GPS systems of a CAV with and without cryptographic authentication. In the use case, we demonstrate how the model can be used to predict the effect of risk reduction measures. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={The security of the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly recognized as a major concern. IoT technology has matured in recent years; however, the same cannot be said for the security of these devices. Despite their efficacy, IoT devices are not secure and are open to vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. The challenge here is to secure the data that IoT devices hold from the external objects or an attack within its network that can hinder the development and put the data at risk. The objective of this research is to investigate the architecture of various IoT systems and to use them to identify the common key components that need to be assessed to minimize the security gap in IoT systems. Based on the current literature a framework is proposed to assess the known vulnerabilities of IoT systems. Currently, there is no standard framework that can be used to assess the security of IoT devices, due to varied constraint in the interconnection of these devices. This research focuses on outlining the vulnerabilities that exist in IoT devices and how these can be assessed using the security assessment framework. It lays the foundation on how this framework evaluates each vulnerability of an IoT System and what can be done to reduce these existing vulnerabilities. The proposed framework provides accurate and realistic assessment outcomes by considering the threats and avoiding the involvement of external factors that can put the assessment process at risk. This framework is designed to combine with other frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27000, COBIT 5, ANSI/ISA 62443, and NIST SP 800-53. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-attacks against critical energy infrastructure have gone from possible to eventual to actual. With electrical generation sources in the United States changing under a wide range of pressures, the current fleet of nuclear power plants in the United States provides a reliable and sustainable source of electrical generation capacity. However, in order to extend the lifetime of the fleet, modernization upgrades to digital instrumentation and control systems are required. While this produces many opportunities for increased efficiency, it introduces a new level of complexity for securing and reliably operating reactors in the presence cyber-threats. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently began urging stronger cybersecurity efforts at nuclear power plants. As upgrades at nuclear power plants begin, the implementation of digital instrumentation and control systems to monitor and run the power plant introduces new vulnerabilities that must be addressed. This necessitates a more modern discussion of risk. Within this context, we critically review past cyber-vulnerability incidents at nuclear installations and other critical facilities. We then analyze challenges to vulnerabilities within the context of modernization of the current nuclear fleet and propose future research directions needed to resolve these issues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a widely adopted standard robotic middleware. However, its preliminary design is devoid of any network security features. Military grade unmanned systems must be guarded against network threats. ROS 2 is built upon the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard and is designed to provide solutions to identified ROS 1 security vulnerabilities by incorporating authentication, encryption, and process profile features, which rely on public key infrastructure. The Department of Defense is looking to use ROS 2 for its military-centric robotics platform. This paper seeks to demonstrate that ROS 2 and its DDS security architecture can serve as a functional platform for use in military grade unmanned systems, particularly in unmanned Naval aerial swarms. In this paper, we focus on the viability of ROS 2 to safeguard communications between swarms and a ground control station (GCS). We test ROS 2's ability to mitigate and withstand certain cyber threats, specifically that of rogue nodes injecting unauthorized data and accessing services that will disable parts of the UAV swarm. We use the Gazebo robotics simulator to target individual UAVs to ascertain the effectiveness of our attack vectors under specific conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROS 2 in mitigating the chosen attack vectors but observed a measurable operational delay within our simulations. © 2019 IEEE.},

The SAaaS can be integrated in an IT healthcare environment allowing the monitoring of existing and new devices, the limitation of connectivity and privileges to new devices, assess a device's cybersecurity risk and-based on the device's behaviour-the assignment and revoking of privileges. The SAaaS brings a controlled cyber aware environment that assures security, confidentiality and trust, even in the presence of non-Trusted devices and environments. © 2019 IEEE.},

Building on the fundamental questions of risk assessment and management, this framework aims to advance the current risk analysis discussions pertaining to the electric power grid. Most of the previous risk-related studies on the electric power grid focus mainly on the recovery of the network from hurricanes and other natural disasters. In contrast, a disproportionately small number of studies explicitly investigate the vulnerability of the electric power grid to cyber-attack scenarios, and how they could be prevented or mitigated. Such a limited approach leaves the United States vulnerable to foreign and domestic threats (both state-sponsored and 'lone wolf') to infiltrate a network that lacks a comprehensive security environment or coordinated government response. By conducting a review of the literature and presenting a risk-based framework, this article underscores the need for a coordinated United States cyber security effort toward formulating strategies and responses conducive to protecting the nation against attacks on the electric power grid. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Smart cities provide fully integrated and networked connectivity between virtual/digital assets and physical building/infrastructure assets to form digital economies. However, industrial espionage, cyber-crime and deplorable politically driven cyber-interventions threaten to disrupt and/or physically damage the critical infrastructure that supports national wealth generation and preserves the health, safety and welfare of the populous. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of cyber-threats confronting critical infrastructure asset management reliant upon a common data environment to augment building information modelling (BIM) implementation. Design/methodology/approach: An interpretivist, methodological approach to reviewing pertinent literature (that contained elements of positivism) was adopted. The ensuing mixed methods analysis: reports upon case studies of cyber-physical attacks; reveals distinct categories of hackers; identifies and reports upon the various motivations for the perpetrators/actors; and explains the varied reconnaissance techniques adopted. Findings: The paper concludes with direction for future research work and a recommendation to utilize innovative block chain technology as a potential risk mitigation measure for digital built environment vulnerabilities. Originality/value: While cyber security and digitization of the built environment have been widely covered within the extant literature in isolation, scant research has hitherto conducted an holistic review of the perceived threats, deterrence applications and future developments in a digitized Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) sector. This review presents concise and lucid reference guidance that will intellectually challenge, and better inform, both practitioners and researchers in the AECO field of enquiry. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The common implementation practices of modern industrial control systems (ICS) has left a window wide open to various security vulnerabilities. As the cyber-threat landscape continues to evolve, the ICS and their underlying architecture must be protected to withstand cyber-attacks. This study aims to review several ICS security assessment methodologies to identify an appropriate vulnerability assessment method for the ICS systems that examine both critical physical and cyber systems so as to protect the national critical infrastructure. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews several ICS security assessment methodologies and explores whether the existing methodologies are indeed sufficient to meet the cyber security assessment exercise required to validate the security of electrical power control systems. Findings: The study showed that most of the examined methodologies seem to concentrate on vulnerability identification and prioritisation techniques, whilst other security techniques received noticeably less attention. The study also showed that the least attention is devoted to patch management process due to the critical nature of the SCADA system. Additionally, this review portrayed that only two security assessment methodologies exhibited absolute fulfilment of all NERC-CIP security requirements, whilst the others only partially fulfilled the essential requirements. Originality/value: This paper presents a review and a comparative analysis of several standard SCADA security assessment methodologies and guidelines published by internationally recognised bodies. In addition, it explores the adequacy of the existing methodologies in meeting cyber security assessment practices required for electrical power networks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Users’ mistakes due to poor cybersecurity skills result in up to 95 per cent of cyber threats to organizations. Threats to organizational information systems continue to result in substantial financial and intellectual property losses. This paper aims to design, develop and empirically test a set of scenarios-based hands-on tasks to measure the cybersecurity skills of non-information technology (IT) professionals. Design/methodology/approach: This study was classified as developmental in nature and used a sequential qualitative and quantitative method to validate the reliability of the Cybersecurity Skills Index (CSI) as a prototype-benchmarking tool. Next, the prototype was used to empirically test the demonstrated observable hands-on skills level of 173 non-IT professionals. Findings: The importance of skills and hands-on assessment appears applicable to cybersecurity skills of non-IT professionals. Therefore, by using an expert-validated set of cybersecurity skills and scenario-driven tasks, this study established and validated a set of hands-on tasks that measure observable cybersecurity skills of non-IT professionals without bias or the high-stakes risk to IT. Research limitations/implications: Data collection was limited to the southeastern USA and while the sample size of 173 non-IT professionals is valid, further studies are required to increase validation of the results and generalizability. Originality/value: The validated and reliable CSI operationalized as a tool that measures the cybersecurity skills of non-IT professionals. This benchmarking tool could assist organizations with mitigating threats due to vulnerabilities and breaches caused by employees due to poor cybersecurity skills. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the current economy, roughly 90% of all world trade is transported by the shipping industry, which is now accelerating its technological growth. While the demand on mariners, ship owners, and the encompassing maritime community for digital advances (particularly towards digitization and automation) has led to efficient shipping operations, maritime cyber-security is a pertinent issue of equal importance. As hackers are becoming increasingly aware of cyber-vulnerabilities within the maritime sector, and as existing risk assessment tools do not adequately represent the unique nature of maritime cyber-threats, this article introduces a model-based risk assessment framework which considers a combination of cyber and maritime factors. Confronted with a range of ship functionalities, configurations, users, and environmental factors, this framework aims to comprehensively present maritime cyber-risks and better inform those in the maritime community when making cyber-security decisions. By providing the needed maritime cyber-risk profiles, it becomes possible to support a range of parties, such as operators, regulators, insurers, and mariners, in increasing overall global maritime cyber-security. © 2019, World Maritime University.},

abstract={A large number of data is generated to help network analysts to evaluate the network security situation in traditional detection and prevention measures, but it is not used fully and effectively, there is not a holistic view of the network situation on it for now. To address this issue, a framework is proposed to evaluate the security situation of the network from three dimensions: threat, vulnerability and stability, and merge the results at decision level to measure the security situation of the overall network. In the case studies, the authors demonstrate how the framework is deployed in the network and how to use it to reflect the security situation of the network in real time. Results of the case study show that the framework can evaluate the security situation of the network accurately and reasonably. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018},

abstract={Many cities are adopting increasingly advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These systems combine connectivity, coordination, adaptivity, and automated response for transportation policy optimization, thus increasing “smartness” and efficiency. However, the control and sensing systems of implemented ITS can open new vulnerabilities, especially to cyber-attacks. Currently vulnerability is managed within the framework of traditional risk assessment that assesses potential failures of the system in response to specified threats. Emerging technologies by their nature have threats that are not fully known, therefore, resilience, defined as the system's ability to recover and adapt to both known and unknown threats, is an emerging area that holds promise for assessing threats to ITS. To illustrate the applicability of resilience to ITS, we conducted a study of network efficiency and resilience in response to random and targeted disruptions of ITS systems in 10 urban areas. Disruptions were generated to affect either intersections or roadways controlled by ITS under different threat scenarios. Modeled attacks, under worst case scenarios, disrupted 20% of intersections causing on average 14.6% more additional delays than the same severity attacks on roadways. Additionally, locking traffic signal states was found to cause more disruption than fully disabling signals. Thus, as cities adopt ITS and other smart systems resulting in potentially unknown vulnerabilities, it is important to consider resilience of transportation infrastructure affected by potential cyber-attacks. © 2019},

abstract={Cyber security is a concern of each citizen, especially when it comes to novel technologies surrounding us in our daily lives. Fighting a cyber battle while enjoying your cup of coffee and observing gentle lights dimming when you move from the kitchen to the sitting room to review your today’s running training, is no longer science fiction. A multitude of the cyber security solutions are currently under development to satisfy the increasing demand on threats and vulnerabilities identification and private data leakage detection tools. Within this domain, ubiquitous decision making to facilitate the life of the regular end-users is a key feature here. In this paper we present a Risk Assessment Model (RAM), originating from Negative to Positive approach, to automate the threat-based Risk Assessment (RA) process, tailored specifically to the smart home environments. The calculation model application is demonstrated on derived threat-triggered evaluation scenarios, which were established from analysing the historical evidence of data communication within the smarthome context. The main features of the proposed RAM are identification of the existing risks, estimation of the consequences on possible positive and negative actions and embedding of the mitigation strategies. The application of this modelling approach for automation of RA would lead to a deep understanding on the extent to which decision making could be automated while tracking and controlling the cyber risks within the end-user’s accepted risk level. Through the proposed RAM, common factors and variables are extracted and integrated into a quantified risk model before being embedded in the automated decision making process. This research falls within the GHOST (Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control) project, aiming to provide a cyber security solution targeted at the regular citizens. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc.

abstract={Threat profiling helps reveal the current trends of attacks, and underscores the significance of specific vulnerabilities, hence serves as the means for providing an early warning of potential attacks. However, the existing approaches on threat profiling models are mainly rule-based and depend on the domain experts’ knowledge, which limit their applicability in the automated processing of cyber threat information from heterogeneous sources, e.g. the cyber threat intelligence information from open sources. The threat profiling models based on analytic approaches, on the other hand, are potentially capable of automatically discovering the hidden patterns from a massive volume of information. This paper proposes to apply the data analytic approaches to develop the threat profiling models in order to identify the potential threats by analyzing a large number of cyber threat intelligence reports from open sources, extract information from the cyber threat intelligence reports, and represent them in a structure that facilitates the automated risk assessment, and hence achieve the early warning of likely cyber attacks. We introduce the Threat Operating Model (TOM) which captures important information of the identified cyber threats, while can be implemented as an extension of the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX). Both the matrix-decomposition based semi-supervised method and the term frequency based unsupervised method are proposed. The experiment results demonstrate a fairly effectiveness (accuracy around 0.8) and a robust performance w.r.t different temporal periods. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The extensive use of information systems has become both a crucial enabler and a critical vulnerability in all spheres of public and private activities. A cyber-security breach may result in interruption, modification, degradation, fabrication, interception, and unauthorized use of an information asset. The resulting damage can be immediate causing direct financial losses or prospective gradually harming the national safety and reputation. In the context of cyber security, risk is present where a threat intersects with a corresponding vulnerability which allows it to manifest. It can be formally expressed as a function of three elements: Probability that a threat may become harmful, Probability that a vulnerability may be exploited, and Resulting impact. While these three elements can be expressed either qualitatively or quantitatively, they are generally described in qualitative terms in the context of cyber security. This paper presents common cyber security risk assessment methods and shows how a risk analysis can be conducted in cyberspace. It proposes a new cyber risk formulation combining statistical and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Risk analysis is defined here as a process that aims to identify, analyze, and reduce or transfer risk. A case study using the most common threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts is presented to illustrate the approach. In this study, a Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) distribution is used to represent the inherent risk curve. A correlation analysis using stochastic simulation is conducted to show how sensitive the overall risk is to the different threats. Risk drivers are therefore assessed and displayed graphically using a pairwise association. The paper results and insights can assist civilian and military decision-makers in identifying critical risk drivers and the need for contingency plans. Statistical techniques and Monte Carlo simulation objectively derive the most likely cyber risk profile. The Loss Exceedance Curve shows for each loss the likelihood of exceeding it. The what-if analysis determines which risk mitigation strategies would have the most impact. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc. All rights reserved.},

We posit that cyber-physical system software has to be designed and developed with security as a key consideration by enforcing fail-safe modes, ensuring critical functionality and risk management.

abstract={Rapid technological advances provide numerous benefits to our ways of work and leisure, banking and transportation, delivery of products and health assistance. The increased interconnectedness among devices, people, networks, and systems, however, introduces a level of complexity surpassing the experience accumulated so far. While the security of communications, network and information systems can be considered a well-established discipline, the study of security of cyber-physical systems is fairly recent. Furthermore, the dependencies of live organisms, including humans, with integrated sensors and electronics, of perceptions and cognition, and variety of drones on influences from cyberspace have been subject of only few, mostly incidental studies. The interdependencies among cyber, physical, biological systems, and humans in situation assessment and decision-making roles create new potential vectors of attack by malicious actors. If exploited, they will lead to cross impact among domains that are usually studied separately. Authors from three Bulgarian institutions, combining research and policy-making experience, embarked on the task to elaborate a comprehensive cybersecurity research agenda. This paper presents their concept for an integrative approach to the exploration of ‘systems of systems.’ The study is structured along five domains: communications and information systems and networks; cyber-physical system; bio-integrated systems; cognitive processes, i.e. the processes of shaping perceptions, assessing a certain situation and options and making decisions; and drones, remotely controlled or autonomous, the latter case being particularly reliant on advances in artificial intelligence. This paper outlines the problem of vulnerability of each of the five domains to influences from cyber space. Then it presents some advances in cross-domain understanding of vulnerabilities, supported by examples of cybersecurity studies, and provides the outlines of a corresponding, interdisciplinary research agenda, built around the concept of systems of systems. The authors conclude by predicting that the field of cybersecurity will be subject to considerable growth in coming years, requiring multi-and inter-disciplinary competencies and scientific support. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc.

abstract={Advanced Train Control System (ATCS) is a proprietary network protocol that expands the functionality and efficiency of Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) systems, by using radio communications (radio code line) for message delivery. However, end-to-end cyber security issues were not considered during initial design of ATCS in the 1980s. Meanwhile, the landscape of cyber-physical threats and vulnerabilities has changed dramatically over the last three decades. Even though cutting-edge systems like Positive Train Control (PTC) have adopted security properties such as integrity check and encryption methods, major railroads in North America still deploy legacy ATCS standards to maintain their individual CTC system. This paper first illustrated the background and general specifications of ATCS applications in North American railroads. The research team has noticed that few studies have systematically analyzed this topic since the emergence of ATCS, though its applications are still prevailing in the industry. Divided by both vital and non-vital operational scenarios, this paper presented case studies for ATCS-related vulnerabilities. We used a sender-receiver sequencing-based analysis and proposed a consequence-based simulation model to identify and further evaluate the cyber and physical risks under potential cyber-attacks. For the identified risk, the paper evaluated the likelihood based on the practical operational sequences, and recommended potential countermeasures for the industry to improve the security over the specific case. The research concluded that the fail-safe design in the ATCS systems would prevent the exploiting known security vulnerabilities which could result in unsafe train movements. However, the service disruptions under certain speculated attacks need further evaluation. At the end of this paper, we discussed our ongoing work for disruption evaluation in the wake of successful cyber attacks. Copyright © 2019 ASME.},

It utilizes a combination of trusted methodologies, self-developed applications and cyber security frameworks to robustly assess a facility’s cyber security posture. This paper also identifies several higher risk issues, which are consistent to many other similar facilities within the power generation industry. Several methods of research were applied to conduct the analysis. Risk assessment tools were also utilized to better identify and quantify issues. A top down list of recommendations are proposed to mitigate against higher risk vulnerabilities. With minor changes, some the proposed recommendations can be applied to many other similarly structured energy plants. Finally, a security checklist, meant to be consumed by other energy plants was also developed. Copyright 2019. © by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics. All rights reserved.},

abstract={While organizations spend millions of dollars on developing security systems at the highest level, one of the most significant areas of weaknesses, and loss remain their employees. Lack of employee training and security expertise, therefore, can cause huge loss, despite other measure being put in place.

Testing, training and employing staff therefore is a critical measure for all organizations to reduce the vulnerabilities yet seems to be an area still not fully addressed. Businesses and organizations need to provide training to promote understanding for staff at every level, so they are aware of their roles and responsibilities in protecting against security threats. However, this is a colossal undertaking, and until this learning gap is resolved, financial institutions must continue to fight and efficiently manage cybersecurity threats. The aim of the current research paper is to present and propose a semi-automated risk assessment framework and a security maturity model, which can be helpful for auditors, security officers and managers. It is based on the ISO 27001 and utilize the relevant standards as well. The related risk management solution is a web-based software application. The current study targeted information security in Kosovo, specifically in the banking sector, IT industry and insurance field. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.},

abstract={This paper presents an approach (CHASE - Cyber Hazard and Security Evaluation) which exploits the collaboration and communication power of bowtie analysis combined with the systematic rigour of HAZOP (or CHAZOP = Computer HAZOP) to efficiently and effectively create Simple and Detailed Risk Assessments associated with the unauthorised operation and/or data manipulations within Industrial Automation Control Systems (IACS). The technique follows the principles of IEC 62443 (via OG-0086) and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance to challenge the IACS zones and conduits (similar to HAZOP nodes and deviations) to identify and evaluate threat events. This enables qualitatively determined appropriate security levels and semi-quantitative prediction of the risks associated with major accidents (COMAH Regulations 2015) and loss of essential services (NIS Regulations 2018). A graphical format allows the analysis team to more quickly and effectively identify the relationship between physical assets containing hazards, or providing essential services, and the IACS assets that are either critical or related to preventing major accidents or loss of essential services. © 2019 IChemE.},

Cyber attacks such as ransomware in general network space have started to spread to mobile devices. In addition, malware that exploits mobile vulnerabilities is also increasing rapidly. Threats to these mobile devices could cause negative damage to human life. Thus, the cyber attack that causes secondary damage to the real world is called a Cyber Influence Attack. This paper presents an influence attack scenario in which the exploit of the Android OS acquires the permission of the mobile device for propagating false information.

abstract={As smartphones such as mobile devices become popular, malicious attackers are choosing them as targets. The risk of attack is steadily increasing as most people store various personal information such as messages, contacts, and financial information on their smartphones. Particularly, the vulnerabilities of the installed operating systems (e.g., Android, iOS, etc.) are trading at a high price in the black market. In addition, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has created a hyperconnected society in which various devices are connected to one network. Therefore, the safety of the smartphone is becoming an important factor to remotely control these technologies. A typical attack method that threatens the security of such a smartphone is a method of inducing installation of a malicious application. However, most studies focus on the detection of malicious applications. This study suggests a method to evaluate threats to be installed in the Android OS environment in conjunction with machine learning algorithms. In addition, we present future direction from the cyber threat intelligence perspective and situational awareness, which are the recent issues. © 2019 Mookyu Park et al.},

abstract={The design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) poses a number of challenges, in particular for cyber-security. Eliciting Security Requirements is a key aspect in the early system design stages; however it is important to assess which requirements are more stringent and grant protection against the higher-value assets. Cyber-security Risk Assessment (SecRA) has a key role in determining threat scenarios and evaluating the risks associated to them but it is a practice that has been principally developed for IT systems, thus focusing on cyber threats. In this chapter, we discuss the state of the art in SecRA methodologies and the challenges to be addressed for developing new CPS-oriented SecRA methodologies. Based on the most relevant standards for industrial control systems and automotive domain (such as the ISA/IEC-62443 and the J3061), we propose the adoption of an asset-driven viewpoint and a model-based approach to SecRA, and we identify current gaps. In particular we discuss (i) CPS (security) modeling languages and methodologies, (ii) vulnerabilities cost models and the network of public repositories of vulnerabilities, (iii) attacker models and profiles, and (iv) complex cyber-physical attack chains. Finally, we discuss our vision, focusing on assets and leveraging model-based design practices can provide a more rigorous approach to SecRA for CPS, allow taking into consideration their peculiarities, and support to manage the large complexity involved in their operation. The desired outcome is to provide the system design team with methods and tools to identify complex attacks and perform a cost/benefit tradeoff analysis to justify the adoption of specific Security Requirements and the necessary costs implied by the corresponding mitigations. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.},

abstract={Cyber resiliency has been a very challenging engineering research. There have been several case studies done to assess cyber resiliency of enterprise business application through application of attack graphs. The challenge of automation lies in extracting from a general business enterprise system, the distinct layers like asset layer, service layer, business process task layer etc., so that the task dependencies together with formal vulnerability specification can be integrated to arrive at attack graphs. In this paper, we develop a model for threat analysis of an enterprise from a set of given vulnerabilities in various layers of the business process. Starting from the business process model (BPMN) of the given enterprise, we first obtain its’ task dependency graph, we obtain the hierarchical dependency graph consisting of asset-, service- and business process-layer. From the graphical dependency graph and the vulnerability specifications we obtain a logical specification of vulnerability/threat propagation for deriving multi step multi stage attacks using MulVAL (MulVAL: http://people.cs.ksu.edu/xou/argus/software/mulval.). The attack graph generated from MulVAL, is imported into the graphical DB, Neo4J so that an online/real-time flexible analysis of vulnerability/threat propagation can be done. We further demonstrate how with additional inputs, it is possible to realize risk analysis of the system. Thus, our integrated model has made threat analysis both re-configurable and scalable. We illustrate the application of our approach to enterprise systems and the power of graphical modeling for the analysis of threat assessments of business enterprise applications. This in turn allows the use of various mitigation techniques for controlling the propagation of threats/vulnerabilities. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The expansion of the information society has brought with it a revolution in the use of Information Communication Technology (ICT). In South Africa, the adoption of various digital devices and technologies has introduced conveniences but at the same time it also opens up the door for various cybercrime attackers. This digital paradox demonstrates that ICT has tremendous capabilities for the rapid provision of services but at the same time can be exploited by malicious cybercriminals. It is vital that organisations and individuals not overlook the strong imperative for cybersecurity. In an interconnected world, cybersecurity and cybercrime go hand in hand. With cyber-attacks and data breaches are on the rise organisations need to be constantly adapting their security measures and preparing for cyber threats. At the end of 2017, a survey was carried out on the state of cyber readiness levels across various sectors in South Africa. The aim of the survey was to identify the current security posture in organisations and ascertain where the gaps were in order to respond to developing cyber threats. Cybersecurity needs to be viewed from various dimensions and thus the survey focused on the status of cybersecurity plans, strategies, governance, standards, Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) membership, awareness programs, vulnerability and risk assessments as well as incident management capabilities. This paper presents the results of the survey which are further analysed in order to contextualise critical findings and recommendations. The survey provided important insights into cyber readiness in South Africa. In this paper the results are placed in context of global trends in order to determine key areas that require attention. It is important to identify how organisations in South Africa should be dealing with disaster recovery planning and how to remain operational when faced with system interruptions and interferences. Contextualising the cyber readiness levels helps asses the latest threat landscape, as well as develop strategies to mitigate these cyber risks. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

abstract={Fog computing has gained tremendous popularity due to its capability of addressing the surging demand on high-quality ubiquitous mobile services. Nevertheless, the highly virtualized environment in fog computing leads to vulnerability to cyber attacks such as advanced persistent threats. In this paper, we propose a novel game approach of cyber risk management for the fog computing platform. The system model under consideration consists of three main entities, i.e., the fog computing provider, attacker, and cyber-insurer. The fog computing provider dynamically optimizes the allocation of its defense computing resources to improve the security of the fog computing platform which is composed of multiple fog nodes. Meanwhile, the attacker dynamically adjusts the allocation of its attack computing resources to increase the probability of successful attack. To prevent from the potential loss due to the attacks, the provider also makes dynamic decision on the subscription of cyber-insurance for each fog node. Thereafter, the cyber-insurer accordingly determines the premium of cyber-insurance for each fog node. To model this dynamic interactive decision making problem, we formulate a dynamic Stackelberg game. We analytically prove that the evolutionary equilibrium is unique and stable, and we investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium by capitalizing on tools from optimal control theory.Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the equilibrium of the dynamic Stackelberg game.

abstract={Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are essential parts in industrial manufacturing plants. With the emerging Industry 4.0 environment, legacy PLCs are now connected to the Internet to be better automated. However, these PLCs are especially vulnerable when connected to a network, since there is limited inherent security mechanisms built in. In this paper, we discuss various vulnerabilities in these PLCs. We describe threat models, detection and protection techniques. We consider vulnerabilities as compromised PLC logic, which is introduced by over-the-network malicious data injection. We leverage Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) techniques, such as output value comparison using majority voting, timing comparison and using known I/O values for detecting such attacks for our Network-Based Intrusion Detection System for PLCs. We mimic functionalities of PLCs, through virtualization of PLCs' ladder logic on OpenPLC [7]. We use a record & replay technique for attack mitigation and system restoration. The record & replay system captures pin values of a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal with sensitivity of 50 microseconds. We implement the attacks and our proposed security solution on the control flow logic of a sample industrial gas pipeline PLC network. We achieve a false positive rate of 1% along with a latency of 25 milliseconds in our abnormal detection with setting of 4 virtual PLCs (using OpenPLC [7]), and generated receiver operating characteristic results on different attack rates and ST file logic settings. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Compliance and an increasing level of cyber maturity form crucial part of corporate defence systems and are the basis of any well-functioning cyber security programme. As the scope of compliance widens with the maturity of the organisation, the human element needs to be addressed as well. Cyber maturity assessments, red teaming and capture the flag exercises help simulate the threat vectors tactics, tools and procedures, give defenders an insight into the enemy motives and help mitigate technical exposure. However, most of these exercises are being delivered with an exclusive aim to achieve technical learning and address incidents on a technical vulnerability level. This chapter looks at how can organisations – having achieved the necessary compliance and governance standards – understand and address human behaviour as cyber security threat. These can be team member’s individual blind-spots and glitches in high-risk team dynamics, which are, if ineffective, are considered system vulnerabilities. When these risk behaviours have been identified and addressed with targeted interventions and training, organisations will be able to mitigate the human risk directly, just as they would patch their on-line systems or scan their networks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

The answers to queries like how susceptible the networks are, what security solutions are required may lie embedded in 'security metrics. An organisation can enhance the security of its IT infrastructure only after assessment and evaluation of the present scenario. SDN's architecture with centralised control and availability of active programming interfaces makes it an ideal choice to devise novel security metrics. The challenges in finding data sources and defining parameters for metrics' formulation have motivated the authors to analyse the existing work and find gaps. Our work is unique and different from other studies in the sense it not only critically analysed the existing work but also propose much-needed ingredients of security metrics.

abstract={Critical infrastructure experienced a transformation from isolated towards highly (inter-)connected systems. This development introduced a variety of new cyber threats, causing high financial damage, threatening lives and affecting the society. Known examples are Stuxnet, WannaCry and the attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. To prevent such attacks, it is indispensable to properly design, assess and maintain countermeasures and security strategies throughout the whole life cycle of the critical systems. For this, security has to be considered and assessed for every system design and redesign. However, common assessment tools and methodologies are not executed on a detailed system knowledge and therefore they are enhanced with penetration tests. Unfortunately, performing only abstract assessments is inadequate and penetration tests endanger the availability of the tested systems. Therefore, the latter cannot be performed on live systems executing critical processes. In this paper, we address these issues for Industrial Control Systems and explain how new concepts for continuous security-by-design or model-based system monitoring and automated vulnerability assessments can resolve them by exploiting new Industry 4.0 developments. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In June 2016, the IAEA commenced a new coordinated research project (CRP) J02008 titled Enhancing Computer Security Incident Response at Nuclear Facilities. The objective of this CRP is to conduct activities which support improved computer security capabilities at nuclear facilities to support the prevention and detection of, and response to, computer security incidents that have the potential to either directly or indirectly adversely affect nuclear safety and nuclear security. This CRP provides the opportunity to participate in four activities to enhance computer security incident analysis and response: (1) Operator support for computer security incident recognition and response; (2) Analysis and technology support for computer security incident response; (3) Computer security Information Exchange; and (4) Cyber Crime Investigation. To achieve these aims, 17 institutes from 13 countries began to conduct research and development on design and construction of research environments that reflect and perform like nuclear facilities and/or their I&C systems. The oversight and coordination of the project led to the definition of three roles: (1) Facility/System Builders; (2) Threat Modellers; and (3) Capability Providing Organizations. Facility/System Builders are organizations that are intending to build mock-ups of nuclear systems as part of their research. The current completed efforts are the first release of a model/simulator that can simulate the impact of cyber attacks on a hypothetical facility. The model/simulator can also be used with compatible hardware in the loop systems. Threat Modellers are organizations that are developing Design Basis Threat (DBT), Scenarios, and Threat Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP). The objective of these organizations is to build upon existing threat models and information exchange to establish a possible threat model applicable to nuclear security. Capability Providing Organizations are organizations that can provide specific capabilities to others in the CRP that stem from their background expertise and/or the research they will be conducting in the CRP, e.g., on vulnerability assessment, security controls assessment, policies. These organizations will be using IEC cyber security standards as a common basis on which to postulate, design, and implement computer security measures with respect to incident response. This paper will provide a summary of the research approaches and the results of the CRP J02008, and preview the final results expected by the end of 2019. © 2018 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved},

abstract={This research examines sources of risk in voting systems, identifies potential vulnerabilities in voting processes, and establishes a risk model framework to assess and mitigate vulnerabilities. Cyber, physical, and insider threats exist in voting systems. Cyber-related threats stem from digital equipment and media, regardless if those devices are connected to the Internet. Physical threats stem from tampering with or disrupting equipment. Insider threats are related to humans interacting with the process and may involve an adversary with intent for deliberate harm or a system user making an honest mistake. This research employs a systems approach to identify potential threats to voting systems. The study examines potential patterns between system characteristics and a history of targeting through correlation analysis. The focus is on a state that uses precinct count optical scanners as a standard for a case study, identifying sources of cyber, physical, and insider threats to that equipment and process. Finally, this paper presents outlines of a preliminary risk model and generalized Markov model to mitigate and manage inherent process risk. Results of this research will enable states to understand and respond to holistic threats, and the model framework can be applied to improve processes and manage risk in voting systems. © 2019 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2019.

abstract={Cyberbiosecurity lies at the intersection of cybersecurity and biosecurity and addresses the protection of valuable biological material and associated information. As an emerging concept, cyberbiosecurity requires the integration of training strategies targeted to both current and future professionals; as well as an increased awareness in the wider stakeholder community. As the discrete discipline of cyberbiosecurity continues to develop, initial training efforts are likely to include workshops and specialized training that bridge the disciplines of information technology (IT) and life sciences. Potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities will be defined, cooperative relationships formed, and collaborative solutions developed. As the scope of the training framework for assessing potential threats is adapted to various audiences, in-service trainings will ensure awareness and understanding of threats relevant to specific industries. This framework may also be incorporated into existing curricula across IT and science fields. The scope of potential threats is vast, and eventual specialization will likely fall within the realm of IT professionals, who carry the capability for action. In this paper, we identify stakeholders in the development of cyberbiosecurity training; discuss current training methods, educational requirements, and credentialing for professionals in cybersecurity, biosecurity, and life sciences; suggest mechanisms for integration of cyberbiosecurity training into existing training approaches; and discuss potential for future development of specialized professionals. © 2019 Richardson, Lewis and Burnette.},

abstract={During recent years, Information societies are continually confronted with security threats and information vulnerabilities. Literature analysis of major disciplines is one of the key tools available to policymakers of research institutions and organizations. Scientometrics is the field of study which concerns itself with measuring and analyzing scientific literature. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the research trends of information security in the Middle-East and the world from a scientometric perspective. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used in this study. The Scopus citation database was used to collect the publication data, as the largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature. Therefore, all documents related to "information security" were retrieved and analyzed. The results showed that the majority of scientific publications in the field of information security were produced in the United States of America and China. Among the Middle-Eastern countries, Iran ranked the first in terms of scientific publications in the field of information security while ranked 23th among the countries of the world. It is apparent that paying special attention to the field of information and data security in terms of international scientific collaborations, using knowledge and experiences of the leading, and supporting research and development in this field can improve the quality and quantity of scientific publications in this field. The expertise gathered during the process will prove invaluable and effective in confronting the security threats and vulnerabilities posed to information societies. © 2019, Somayeh Parvin, Farahnaz Sadoughi, Arman Karimi, Masoud Mohammadi and Farzaneh Aminpour.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has a significant impact on agriculture. So-called Smart Farming uses drones and a variety of sensors to measure climate, irrigation, soil moisture or GPS position. With this rapid influx of technology increases the threat that vulnerabilities in those technologies are being exploited for malicious intent. To show the impact of cyberattacks on agriculture, we present a simulation of several attacks on a ZigBee-based wireless sensor network. We conduct a delay attack, an interference attack and three different routing attacks (sinkhole, blackhole and selective forwarding attack). Those attacks are simulated using NETA with the OMNET++ framework. We will show that the security of WSN is influenced by factors like energy consumption or computation power, which can conflict with other interests like low per-unit costs. © 2019 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

abstract={The convergence of advances in biotechnology with laboratory automation, access to data, and computational biology has democratized biotechnology and accelerated the development of new therapeutics. However, increased access to biotechnology in the digital age has also introduced additional security concerns and ultimately, spawned the new discipline of cyberbiosecurity, which encompasses cybersecurity, cyber-physical security, and biosecurity considerations. With the emergence of this new discipline comes the need for a logical, repeatable, and shared approach for evaluating facility and system vulnerabilities to cyberbiosecurity threats. In this paper, we outline the foundation of an assessment framework for cyberbiosecurity, accounting for both security and resilience factors in the physical and cyber domains. This is a unique problem set, but despite the complexity of the cyberbiosecurity field in terms of operations and governance, previous experience developing and implementing physical and cyber assessments applicable to a wide spectrum of critical infrastructure sectors provides a validated point of departure for a cyberbiosecurity assessment framework. This approach proposes to integrate existing capabilities and proven methodologies from the infrastructure assessment realm (e.g., decision science, physical security, infrastructure resilience, cybersecurity) with new expertise and requirements in the cyberbiosecurity space (e.g., biotechnology, biomanufacturing, genomics) in order to forge a flexible and defensible approach to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities. Determining where vulnerabilities reside within cyberbiosecurity business processes can help public and private sector partners create an assessment framework to identify mitigation options for consideration that are both economically and practically viable and ultimately, allow them to manage risk more effectively. © 2019 Schabacker, Levy, Evans, Fowler and Dickey.},

abstract={In a time of growing threats and advancing circumstances, receiving and keeping up a strong cybersecurity profile in the enterprises are crucial. Important data and resources must be protected. Nowadays, cybersecurity became a predominant issue facing most organizations. It is recognized by organizations as an enterprise-wide issue requiring protection and detection from possible and malicious attacks to protect enterprise information assets. Hence, enterprises are obligated to use multiple tools for covering most of the cybersecurity aspects through different operations and for supporting different levels of users. Information systems auditing is becoming more difficult due to the rapidly developing technological threats. Hence, having these audits and reviews performed by independent functions increase the likelihood of detecting control weaknesses and provides further checks. These control issues are typically not due to the failure of the technology. However, they are mostly the result of individuals not executing the process, or using a process that is poorly defended. The main purpose of this research is to make a comparative study of the capabilities of most of the available automated cybersecurity auditing tools for frontend cloud computing. The results of this comparative study lead to knowing how to secure the enterprise's assets by using automated tools and techniques. Also, it uses clear steps to gather the information to provide the evidence required in the final report of IS auditing. © 2018 IEEE.},

First, an overview of cyber threats to PMU networks is given where the possible vulnerabilities of the network to malicious data manipulation are studied. The addition of PMUs to the power system infrastructure would offer greater observability in the system and thus mitigate the risk of transmission line failure due to thermal overloading. However, the addition of PMUs opens the system to cyber threats that might, in fact, lower system reliability. The analysis in this work looks at the effect of these threats on the overall system reliability of a real system layout based on real PMU data obtained from a utility. The benefit to a utility in including PMUs under the varying levels of cyber threat is also studied. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The growing complexity of global interconnected risk suggests that a shift has occurred in the way emergency planners need to improve preparedness and response to cascading events. With reference to the literature from the physical, social and political sciences, this paper analyses extreme space weather events and cyberattacks. The goal of this work is to produce a replicable scenario-building process, based on cross-disciplinary understanding of vulnerability, that could be complementary to probabilistic hazard assessment. Our hypothesis is that the technological and human component of critical infrastructure could be the primary vector for the escalation of secondary emergencies. While not themselves having direct implications in terms of loss of life, elements that are common to different risks could provide particular challenges for disaster management. Our findings identify some vulnerable nodes, such as Global Navigation Satellite System technology and remote-control systems, that could act as paths for the escalations of events. We suggest that these paths may be common to various known and unknown threats. We propose two scenarios of Massive, OveRwhelming Disruption of OpeRations (M.OR.D.OR.) that could be used for testing emergency preparedness strategies, and increasing the response to highly complex, unknown events. The conclusions highlight the open challenges of seeking to increase societal resilience. The limitations of this work are described, as are the possible challenges for future research. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To manage cybersecurity risks in practice, a simple yet effective method to assess suchs risks for individual systems is needed. With time-to-compromise (TTC), McQueen et al. (2005) introduced such a metric that measures the expected time that a system remains uncompromised given a specific threat landscape. Unlike other approaches that require complex system modeling to proceed, TTC combines simplicity with expressiveness and therefore has evolved into one of the most successful cybersecurity metrics in practice. We revisit TTC and identify several mathematical and methodological shortcomings which we address by embedding all aspects of the metric into the continuous domain and the possibility to incorporate information about vulnerability characteristics and other cyber threat intelligence into the model. We propose β-TTC, a formal extension of TTC which includes information from CVSS vectors as well as a continuous attacker skill based on a β-distribution. We show that our new metric (1) remains simple enough for practical use and (2) gives more realistic predictions than the original TTC by using data from a modern and productively used vulnerability database of a national CERT. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-attacks become more and more complex, but the network situation assessment based on log analysis cannot meet the security requirements because of the low quality of logs and alerts. This paper addresses the lack of consideration of security attributes of hosts and attacks in network. What's more, the most common attacks, identity and effectiveness of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) are hard to be proved in risk assessment based on alerts and flow matching. The multi-dimension threat situation assessment method based on network security attributes is proposed in this paper. Firstly, it gives an adaptive Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) calculation, which considers asset value as environment metric. Secondly, it collects deterioration rate of properties by sensors in hosts and network, that aims at assessing the time and level of DDoS attacks. Thirdly, it adopts the distribution of asset value in security attributes considering the features of attacks and network, which aims at assessing and showing the whole situation. Experiments demonstrate that the results show the primary threat and security requirement of network. By comparison and analytic study, the method reflects more in security requirement and security risk situation than traditional methods based on alert and flow analyzing. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of sensors and actuators as a form of controlling cyber-physical systems in resource networks has been integrated and referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the connectivity of many stand-alone IoT systems through the Internet introduces numerous cybersecurity challenges as sensitive information is prone to be exposed to malicious users. This paper focuses on the improvement of IoT cybersecurity from an ontological analysis, proposing appropriate security services adapted to the threats. The authors propose an ontology-based cybersecurity framework using knowledge reasoning for IoT, composed of two approaches: (1) design time, which provides a dynamic method to build security services through the application of a model-driven methodology considering the existing enterprise processes; and (2) run time, which involves monitoring the IoT environment, classifying threats and vulnerabilities, and actuating in the environment ensuring the correct adaptation of the existing services. Two validation approaches demonstrate the feasibility of our concept. This entails an ontology assessment and a case study with an industrial implementation. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={With the surge in data-intensive science applications, the campus cloud infrastructures are increasingly dealing with sensitive data that has strict security requirements. However, in most cases due to lack of sophisticated security frameworks and trained personnel, such campus private clouds (CPC) are not fully equipped to handle sophisticated integrity, availability, and confidentiality attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of a cost-effective, and implementationally simpler Moving Target Defense (MTD) based cloud resource adaptation approach that significantly reduces the probability of attack success. In particular, we propose a Bayesian Attack Graph (BAG) based threat assessment model. Our proposed model follows Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) impact evaluation recommendations. As a case study, We use our graph based threat assessment model to demonstrate the utility of MTD against attacks on City University of New York (CUNY) research network. The study involves unique scenarios with multiple confidentiality, integrity, and availability related vulnerabilities being exploited by attacks from different network locations. Finally, we simulate a CUNY research network in GENI environment to validate our BAG model by emulating attack scenarios and observing system resilience with and without MTD. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Underground mining operations require robust and efficient communication like other industrial enterprises. Communication in the mining industry is the most critical factor to ensure the safety and security of the underground working environment. A robust IT communication infrastructure in underground mining will enhance safety and provide information in real-time which can result in a quick response to some fatal situation. Communication technologies that are capable of bearing the rough terrain and extreme environment inside a mine and between the surface and underground workstations is a critical factor for the monitoring of various underground mining operations remotely. Internet of Things (IoT) can play a massive role in the mining operations to improve the safety of the workers with enhanced productivity. Wireless communication, which is a part of IoT setup, is already playing a vital role in underground mine communication (UMC). Recently, IoT with its building blocks has been introduced to deploy and automate the operation of 'self-advancing goaf edge support (SAGES)’ systems in an attempt to explore the possibility of the technology for real-time performance monitoring of support system including the behaviour of overlying roof strata in underground coal mines. The machine helps in supporting the roof of the mines during mining the coal. This paper presents a conceptual framework for implementation of IoT to make this underground support system smarter i.e. Smart-SAGES. The taxonomy of security challenges in UMC IoT combination has been described in detail in order to identify clear security goals. The blockchain based system seems to be a promising technology for the mining industry as it may help in curbing the penetration and disruption of cyber-attacks due to heterogeneous devices and distributed network. Various open issues in UMC have also been outlined. Vulnerabilities like information disclosure and Denial-of-Service attack (DoS attack) were discovered during the threat and risk analysis on the SAGES data logger. The SAGES falls into information generation block of IoT ecosystem. Therefore, it is advisable to incorporate the security by design approach from the initial phase of the development. Thus, the data transmission and storage can be made secure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years maritime logistics infrastructures are the global links among societies and economies. This challenges adversaries to intrude on the cyber-dependent ICTs by performing high-level intelligent techniques. A potential cyber-attack on such infrastructures can cause tremendous damages starting from supply chain service disruption ending up with threatening the whole human welfare. Current risk management policies embed significant limitations in terms of capturing the specific security requirements of ICTs and control/monitoring devices, such as IoT platforms, satellites and time installations, which are primary functioning for the provision of Maritime Logistics and Supply Chain (MLoSC) services. This work presents a novel risk assessment methodology capable of addressing the security particularities and specificities of the complex nature of SCADA infrastructures and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) of the Maritime Logistics Industry. The methodology identifies asset vulnerabilities and threats to estimate the cyber-risks and their cascading effects within the supply chain, introducing a set of subsequent security assessment services. The utilization of these services is demonstrated via a critical, real-life SCADA scenario indicating how they can facilitate supply chain operators in comprehending the threat landscape of their infrastructures and guide them how to adopt optimal mitigation strategies to counter or eliminate their cyber-risks. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Due to the characteristics and connectivity of today's Cyber-Physical Control Systems (CPCS) and critical infrastructures, cyber-attacks on these systems are currently difficult to prevent in an efficient and sustainable manner. Prevention and mitigation need accurate identification and evaluation of: system vulnerabilities, likely threats and attacks, and applicable hardening measures. Furthermore, the ability to prioritize hardening measures based on accurate assessments of threat risk and consequence and mitigation availability, applicability, and cost is also needed. To address this challenge we created HESTIA: High-level and Extensible System for Training and Infrastructure risk Assessment. In this paper, we describe the latest architecture and working principles of HESTIA. When fully developed, the HESTIA process and tool-set will enable CPCS engineers to, iteratively: 1) specify a CPCS, 2) select applicable attacks and hardening measures from a library, 3) check specifications for consistency and applicability, and 4) merge attack and hardening specifications into a new CPCS model. In addition, we add support for device specification templates. HESTIA enables the discovery of attack-defend scenarios through simulation and the design of optimal hardening strategies for a given CPCS. This paper is a shortened and updated version of a journal article entitled An architecture for HESTIA to appear in the International Journal of Internet of Things and Cyber-Assurance. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Attaining and keeping cyber situational awareness is crucial for the proper incident response, especially in critical infrastructures. Incident handlers need to process heterogeneous data, such as network topology and organisation’s missions and objectives, to effectively mitigate the threats. The development of tools for attaining cyber situational awareness often faces the problem of effectively obtaining, correlating, and storing such heterogeneous data. In this paper, we present CRUSOE, an extensible layered data model for attaining and keeping information on cyber situational awareness. We conducted interviews with incident handlers from several security teams and evaluated existing requirements on cyber situational awareness to formalise the requirements on the proposed data model so that can be used in today’s common network settings. The CRUSOE data model keeps track of missions, systems, networks, hosts, threats, detection and response capabilities, and access control in a network of an organisation. It is also designed to be filled primarily with the data that can be obtained in a semi- or fully-automated fashion in today’s common network environments. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Future railway systems should bring convenience to people's lives. In fact, due to the move away from bespoke standalone systems to open-platform, standardized equipments and increasing use of networked control and automation systems and connected technologies, the efficiency and the safety of railway services are improving. However, this dependence of automation, control and communication technologies makes railway systems becoming increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks and security threats which affects the overall performance. This paper deals with cybersecurity concerns facing these systems. As such, we analyse characteristics of railway threat landscape. Then, we discuss the direct impacts of the identified potential threats and their consequences on the whole system and we evaluate resulted risks. For space limitation, we choose to present the impact, likelihood and risk analysis for one functionality of the system, namely External Door control (EDC). Some good practices and related techniques for the development of safer, more comfortable, and more secure future railway systems are also discussed. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates how the Insider Threat Cybersecurity Framework (ITCF) web tool and methodology help provide a more dynamic, defense-in-depth security posture against insider cyber and cyber-physical threats. ITCF includes over 30 cybersecurity best practices to help organizations identify, protect, detect, respond and recover to sophisticated insider threats and vulnerabilities. The paper tests the efficacy of this approach and helps validate and verify ITCF's capabilities and features through various insider attacks use-cases. Two case-studies were explored to determine how organizations can leverage ITCF to increase their overall security posture against insider attacks. The paper also highlights how ITCF facilitates implementation of the goals outlined in two Presidential Executive Orders to improve the security of classified information and help owners and operators secure critical infrastructure. In realization of these goals, ITCF: provides an easy to use rapid assessment tool to perform an insider threat self-assessment; determines the current insider threat cybersecurity posture; defines investment-based goals to achieve a target state; connects the cybersecurity posture with business processes, functions, and continuity; and finally, helps develop plans to answer critical organizational cybersecurity questions. In this paper, the webtool and its core capabilities are tested by performing an extensive comparative assessment over two different high-profile insider threat incidents. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) are vital for countries’ industrial facilities and critical infrastructures. However, there are not enough security assessments against cyber attacks carried out on ICS for not preventing business continuity. New attacks are being made every day against these systems. Threats and attacks against critical infrastructures must be detected for protecting human life and assets. For this reason, detection has become more important than the prevention of attacks. In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the critical systems. In the analysis, mirroring technique was used to prevent the detection system from imposing additional load to the existing system and affecting the operation of the system negatively. In the test environment, Siemens S-7 1200 (Firmware 2.2) PLC devices were used. Smoothsec system, which is not used in industrial systems, is used for detection and rule table. It is assessed that this novel approach will provide significant contributions to attract attention to vulnerabilities and the security analysis of industrial control systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={It is becoming increasingly necessary for organizations to build a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform to fight against sophisticated attacks. To reduce the risk of cyber attacks, security administrators and/or analysts can use a CTI platform to aggregate relevant threat information about adversaries, targets and vulnerabilities, analyze it and share key observations from the analysis with collaborators. In this paper, we introduce CyTIME (Cyber Threat Intelligence ManagEment framework) which is a framework for managing CTI data. CyTIME can periodically collect CTI data from external CTI data repositories via standard interfaces such as Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information (TAXII). In addition, CyTIME is designed to automatically generate security rules without human intervention to mitigate discovered new cybersecurity threats in real time. To show the feasibility of CyTIME, we performed experiments to measure the time to complete the task of generating the security rule corresponding to a given CTI data. We used 1,000 different CTI files related to network attacks. Our experiment results demonstrate that CyTIME automatically generates security rules and store them into the internal database within 12.941 seconds on average (max = 13.952, standard deviation = 0.580). © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Threat assessment of systems is critical to organizations' security policy. Identifying systems likely to be at-risk by threat actors can help organizations better defend against likely cyber attacks. Currently, identifying such systems to a large extent is guided by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Previous research has demonstrated poor correlation between a high CVSS score and at-risk systems. In this paper, we look at hacker discussions on darkweb marketplaces and forums to identify the platforms, vendors, and products likely to be at-risk by hackers. We propose a reasoning system that combines DeLP (Defeasible Logic Programming) and machine learning classifiers to identify systems based on hacker discussions observed on the darkweb. The resulting system is therefore a hybrid between classical knowledge representation and reasoning techniques and machine learning classifiers. We evaluate the system on hacker discussions collected from nearly 300 darkweb forums and marketplaces provided by a threat intelligence company. We improved precision by 15%-57% while maintaining recall over baseline approaches. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Industrial and Automation Control systems traditionally achieved security thanks to the use of proprietary protocols and isolation from the telecommunication networks. Nowadays, the advent of the Industrial Internet of Things poses new security challenges. In this paper, we first highlight the main security challenges that advocate for new risk assessment and security strategies. To this end, we propose a security framework and advanced tools to properly manage vulnerabilities, and to timely react to the threats. The proposed architecture fills the gap between computer science and control theoretic approaches. The physical layers connected to Industrial Control Systems are prone to disrupt when facing cyber-attacks. Considering the modules of the proposed architecture, we focus on the development of a practical framework to compare information about physical faults and cyber-attacks. This strategy is implemented in the ATENA architecture that has been designed as an innovative solution for the protection of critical assets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Indian Power System is presently having Power Generation of around 335 GW & the National Transmission Grid of EHVAC/UHVAC/HVDC is being managed by POSOCO through NLDC at National level & 5 Nos RLDCs at Regional levels to schedule & dispatch power efficiently to all states in a very transparent manner following all Regulatory guidelines/Grid Codes. Renewable Energy is now top priority of GoI as 100 GW of Grid connected Solar & 40 GW of Roof top Solar capacity is planned besides Wind generation plans & RE will contribute about 40% of total generation by 2030. RE integration into the Transmission & Distribution Grids will be a major challenge & will be met by deploying tools e.g. Forecasting, Balancing mechanisms, Market Mechanisms, Ancillary Services, Flexible Transmission, Compliance to Standards & Grid Codes, Fault Ride Through (FRT) and Low Voltage ride through capabilities. Renewable Energy Management Centers (REMC) are also being set up shortly. At COP 21 in Paris, India made a commitment that 40% of electricity generation by 2030 will be from Renewables, which again translates into several hundred GWs of renewable energy capacity addition. The traditional electricity networks designed for unidirectional flow of electricity, revenue and information will have a paradigm shift to bidirectional flow of these elements. Before the advent of Smart Grids, communication networks were used to monitor and control power flow using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)/ Energy Management Systems (EMS). Control & monitoring is now reaching upto the end consumer. Secure, reliable, scalable, interoperable and cost effective communication networks is required for Smart metering, SCADA, Substation and Distribution Automation, Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS) etc. It is believed that the grid will soon emerge as a ‘Grid of Things’ just like the Internet has evolved as the ‘Internet of Things’. Different applications in a Smart Grid would have different bandwidth, latency, reliability and scalability requirements. Nationwide Optical Fiber OPGW network on EHV Transmission lines is a unique communication back-bone system to support all types of Smart Grid technologies with high speed & very low latency. Indian Power System has great potential for various automation technology trials in Smart Grid domain & Cyber Security has assumed high importance in view of the increasing threats to power Sector. Large RE capacity addition programs in years ahead will unfold interesting Power Sector scenario in India. As India is already an “Information Technology Leader”, Smart Grid deployment in Power Sector has provided quantum jump to Information & Communication Technology (ICT) domain but Cyber Security vulnerabilities have posed bigger challange.

abstract={Distributed cooperative control mode is an effective approach to overcome the problem of integrating multiple and strongly random distributed generators (DGs) into cyber-physical system in distribution network. However, due to the integration between cyber and physical layers, cyber attacks could threat the safe and stable operation of power system through invading the cyber system. Toward this end, a dynamic attack-defense game model based vulnerability assessment of cyber-physical system (CPS) in distribution network is proposed. Firstly, a cooperative control strategy of DGs is described, and its convergence property is analyzed and summarized. Then, a risk assessment of CPS in distribution network is developed, which integrates the risk assessment method, the cooperative control strategy of DGs and strategies of attacker and defender. After that, the dynamic attack-defense game function and its solving steps are designed, which achieves the vulnerability assessment of CPS in distribution network with distributed cooperative control mode. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations involving the IEEE 34-bus distribution network. © 2018 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.},

abstract={This paper describes the impacts of criminal activities based on the nature of the crime, the victim, and the basis (whether short-term or long-range/term) of the impacts of cybercrime on Internet. Recently many countries are facing numerous cyber threats including DoS (and DDoS), malware, website defamation, spam and phishing email attacks. Due to these cybercrimes evolution, identifying and assessing security risk is crucial to access data from new technologies, and also trying to understand how technologies can be abused. Therefore, there is a need to develop a special cyber security risk assessment model to tackle over these cyber threats. In this paper, we propose to utilize Fuzzy Inference Model (FIS) to produce risk assessment result based on the four risk factors which are: vulnerability, threat, likelihood and impact to specify the range of risks that can threaten any entity and try to solve such issues to proposed entities. We have performed various analyses on this factors and finally, our evaluation results show the viability of our proposed approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The HPC Architecture for Cyber Situational Awareness (HACSAW) was established by the Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) to combine a rich computational environment with operationally relevant data to perform cutting-edge cybersecurity research that will increase HPCMP’s current and predictive understanding of cyberspace on the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN). The data repository created by this unique environment includes the collection of unclassified data sources from the edge of the network (i.e., Internet Access Points) down to the host-level, across more than one hundred (100) different DoD enclaves. Through the application of high performance computing (HPC) resources, HACSAW explores novel and innovative analytical capabilities based on a comprehensive cybersecurity dataset. The integration of HPC within the cyber work-flow provides an opportunity for fusion and assessments of disparate data streams and real-time analysis using data science algorithms and machine learning (both structured and unstructured data). Our approach is designed to ultimately leverage HPC resources to significantly reduce the time to respond to changes in the cyber environment from days to minutes. Understanding the operational status of information systems, the missions (friendly and adversary) being pursued, and the threats and vulnerabilities that impact them is essential for effective mission accomplishment. This understanding is referred to as Cyberspace Situational Awareness (Cyber SA). Today’s decision makers require meaningful Cyber SA to safeguard sensitive data, sustain fundamental operations, and protect national infrastructure [2]. The need and responsibility of Cyber SA spans multiple organizations within the DoD, across the entire government and in the private sector. The lack of relevant and recent real-world network enterprise data has hampered many cybersecurity research efforts to develop and validate algorithms or methods under realistic conditions. HACSAW has reduced this technical barrier with a development environment that provides computational and data-rich information to researchers to test, develop, model, measure and refine data-driven analytics. This environment is the proving ground for novel ideas, algorithms and approaches that are suitable for large scale execution in a dedicated HPC environment. Currently, HACSAW as an aggregation of over one (1) petabyte of DREN data to include network-based monitoring and intrusion detection results, web content filtering, vulnerability scanning, firewall, sensor health, etc. Context is applied to each cyber event through the use of custom enrichments that provide downstream analytical processes with information that may be useful in determining the nature of the event. During this talk, we will discuss HPCMP’s initial approach to addressing Cyber SA through a Call for Proposals (CFP) to the data science, cyber, and HPC communities. Selected collaborators will receive funding for a one-year effort that demonstrates potential for integration into DREN’s Cyber SA operational environment and aligns with identified Mission Essential Tasks (METs). METs will ensure decision makers have the understanding necessary to make effective decisions. Such tasks include monitoring, detection, alerting, cyber threat analysis, cyber risk and event analysis, and sharing and collaboration. Initial and future contributions in the areas of modeling and simulation [4], clustering [3] and deep learning [1] are anticipated and results will be shared at a later date. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={We present a quantitative business-process risk assessment methodology that utilizes formal mathematical distributions over historical data to enable better granularity and less subjective assessment on cyber-physical systems (CPS) and IT systems that use cloud services in general. The proposed methodology supports risks on asset-based processes associated with cloud computing platforms. ISO and US standards for cloud platforms are used to detect cloud-based attack vectors, threats and vulnerabilities both for CPS and traditional IT systems. Poisson distributions are proposed as a scientific means to quantify the likelihood of threat manifestation for assessing security risks. The key advantage of the presented method is its non-subjective likelihood threat estimation (contrary to current standards) and its ability to assess risk based on novel asset-based processes that fully support cloud services and CPS, which can aid stakeholders to comparatively assess the risk of using cloud services to process data. A real-world critical infrastructure was used to compare results of the presented methodology with its current security plan. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm focusing on the connection of devices, objects, or “things” to each other, to the Internet, and to users. IoT technology is anticipated to become an essential requirement in the development of smart homes, as it offers convenience and efficiency to home residents so that they can achieve better quality of life. Application of the IoT model to smart homes, by connecting objects to the Internet, poses new security and privacy challenges in terms of the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the data sensed, collected, and exchanged by the IoT objects. These challenges make smart homes extremely vulnerable to different types of security attacks, resulting in IoT-based smart homes being insecure. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the possible security risks to develop a complete picture of the security status of smart homes. This article applies the operationally critical threat, asset, and vulnerability evaluation (OCTAVE) methodology, known as OCTAVE Allegro, to assess the security risks of smart homes. The OCTAVE Allegro method focuses on information assets and considers different information containers such as databases, physical papers, and humans. The key goals of this study are to highlight the various security vulnerabilities of IoT-based smart homes, to present the risks on home inhabitants, and to propose approaches to mitigating the identified risks. The research findings can be used as a foundation for improving the security requirements of IoT-based smart homes. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The Higher Education Institutions (HEI) readiness to cyber security threats has gotten less consideration than certain organizations and financial companies and the need to address these kinds of adversities are necessary in colleges and universities. These institutions face challenges which are unique to the way they operate, meaning they have to seek out appropriate solutions to keep their assets safe and secure. Threat-Driven Approach is a systematic approach that is driven by a clear understanding of the security need. Using this systematic approach, the strength of a protection is easily gauged through simple identification of the weakest link of the network. Various Threat Driven approach have been proposed, but most of the study focuses on the security of software development and business infrastructure. Based on the existing literature, there is no HEI that are practicing the systematic approach in securing their assets. The primary purpose of this paper is to enable HEI to apply this approach and will provide detailed guidance that will enable HEI to place threats at the forefront of planning, design, testing, deployment and operational activities. The THREAT DRIVEN APPROACH is a set of integrated methodology, practices and tools into one framework/model. The STRIDE and DREAD are also used in this study to identify and calculate the potential threats of the Network Security. As a result, our approach can make network design secured from anticipated security threats and, thus, reduce significant design-level vulnerabilities. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Cyber attacks have been increasingly detrimental to networks, systems, and users, and are increasing in number and severity globally. To better predict system vulnerabilities, cybersecurity researchers are developing new and more holistic approaches to characterizing cybersecurity system risk. The process must include characterizing the human factors that contribute to cyber security vulnerabilities and risk. Rationality, expertise, and maliciousness are key human characteristics influencing cyber risk within this context, yet maliciousness is poorly characterized in the literature. There is a clear absence of literature pertaining to human factor maliciousness as it relates to cybersecurity and only limited literature relating to aspects of maliciousness in other disciplinary literatures, such as psychology, sociology, and law. In an attempt to characterize human factors as a contribution to cybersecurity risk, the Cybersecurity Collaborative Research Alliance (CSec-CRA) has developed a Human Factors risk framework. This framework identifies the characteristics of an attacker, user, or defender, all of whom may be adding to or mitigating against cyber risk. The maliciousness literature and the proposed maliciousness assessment metrics are discussed within the context of the Human Factors Framework and Ontology. Maliciousness is defined as the intent to harm. Most maliciousness cyber research to date has focused on detecting malicious software but fails to analyze an individual's intent to do harm to others by deploying malware or performing malicious attacks. Recent efforts to identify malicious human behavior as it relates to cybersecurity, include analyzing motives driving insider threats as well as user profiling analyses. However, cyber-related maliciousness is neither well-studied nor is it well understood because individuals are not forced to expose their true selves to others while performing malicious attacks. Given the difficulty of interviewing malicious-behaving individuals and the potential untrustworthy nature of their responses, we aim to explore the maliciousness as a human factor through the observable behaviors and attributes of an individual from their actions and interactions with society and networks, but to do so we will need to develop a set of analyzable metrics. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to review human maliciousness-related literature in diverse disciplines (sociology, economics, law, psychology, philosophy, informatics, terrorism, and cybersecurity); and (2) to identify an initial set of proposed assessment metrics and instruments that might be culled from in a future effort to characterize human maliciousness within the cyber realm. The future goal is to integrate these assessment metrics into holistic cybersecurity risk analyses to determine the risk an individual poses to themselves as well as other networks, systems, and/or users. © 2018 King, Henshel, Flora, Cains, Hoffman and Sample.},

Those five core elements were crafted to address evolving cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. With the BCF, an organization will be able to: assess their target cybersecurity state and current cybersecurity posture; identify and prioritize improvement opportunities and necessary actions by continuous and repeatable process; assess progress towards the target state; and communicate cybersecurity risk among internal and external stakeholders. This paper is a miniature of the ∼100-page Buildings Cybersecurity Framework, and the goal of this paper is to explicate the applicability of BCF in different types of buildings such as Residential, Small Commercial, Large Commercial, and Federal buildings.

abstract={Context Software-intensive space systems can harbor defects and vulnerabilities that may enable external adversaries or malicious insiders to disrupt or disable system functions, risking mission compromise or loss. Mitigating this risk demands a sustained focus on the security and resiliency of the system architecture including software, hardware, and other components. Objective In this paper we offer methodical approaches for improving space system resiliency through software architecture design, system engineering, and increased software security, thereby reducing the risk of latent software defects and vulnerabilities. Method We conducted a systematic review of existing architectural practices, standards, security and coding practices, various threats, defects, and vulnerabilities that impact space systems from hundreds of relevant publications and interviews of subject matter experts. We expanded on the system-level body of knowledge for resiliency and identified a new software architecture framework and acquisition methodology to improve the resiliency of space systems from a software perspective with an emphasis on the early phases of the systems engineering life cycle. This methodology involves seven steps: 1) Define technical resiliency requirements, 1a) Identify standards/policy for software resiliency, 2) Develop a request for proposal (RFP)/statement of work (SOW) for resilient space systems software, 3) Define software resiliency goals for space systems, 4) Establish software resiliency quality attributes, 5) Perform architectural tradeoffs and identify risks, 6) Conduct architecture assessments as part of the procurement process, and 7) Ascertain space system software architecture resiliency metrics. Results Data illustrates that software vulnerabilities can lead to opportunities for malicious cyber activities, which could degrade the space mission capability for its user community. Reducing the number of vulnerabilities by improving architecture and software system engineering practices can contribute to making space systems more resilient. Conclusion Since cyber-attacks [1] are enabled by shortfalls in software, robust software engineering practices and an architectural design are foundational to resiliency, which is a quality that allows the system to take a hit to a critical component and recover in a known, bounded, and generally acceptable period of time. To achieve software resiliency for space systems, acquirers and suppliers must identify relevant factors and systems engineering practices to apply across the life cycle, in software requirements analysis, architecture development, design, implementation, verification and validation, and maintenance phases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as billions of devices and wirelessly connected systems will soon be adopting various IoT technologies and exchanging potentially sensitive information. IoT devices can be deployed and linked to cloud services using local Wi-Fi and cellular Internet connections via IPv6. However, as a distributed environment for an open market and a rich source of 'big data' with unlimited systems interactions, the IoT would allow attackers to identify many vulnerable targets and to launch their attacks. Such vulnerabilities and attacks could have an impact on any number of services and systems within and across different critical infrastructures. The major problem is that the existing IoT mechanisms and protocols have not been designed to deal with such challenges. Therefore, the security of the IoT has come into question which means that, in order to be secure, the IoT will require robust and secure objects, protocols and systems. Recent advances in the fields of IoT such as embedded systems security, industrial malware analysis, detection and prevention are a key factor in the growth of IoT services and operations. This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on wireless technologies and on the role of IoT in the healthcare sector in particular. IoT systems and their users are vulnerable to a range of security threats and malicious activities. Therefore, rigorous research is required to develop security approaches and technologies that are capable of responding to this new evolving environment. This paper presents different risks and security threats to the IoT, some security measures and solution models as well as a vulnerability assessment approach for the IoT in the healthcare sector. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This textbook presents a practical introduction to information security using the Competency Based Education (CBE) method of teaching. The content and ancillary assessment methods explicitly measure student progress in the three core categories: Knowledge, Skills, and Experience, giving students a balance between background knowledge, context, and skills they can put to work. Students will learn both the foundations and applications of information systems security; safeguarding from malicious attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities; auditing, testing, and monitoring; risk, response, and recovery; networks and telecommunications security; source code security; information security standards; and compliance laws. The book can be used in introductory courses in security (information, cyber, network or computer security), including classes that don't specifically use the CBE method, as instructors can adjust methods and ancillaries based on their own preferences.

abstract={Medical devices are complex cyber-physical systems incorporating emergent hardware and software components. In addition, interoperability and communication capabilities have been augmented, increasing the convenience and functionality of such devices. However, this complexity leads to a wide attack surface posing security risks and vulnerabilities. Mitigation and management of such risks during premarket design and postmarket deployment are required. Dynamically mitigating threat potential in the presence of unknown vulnerabilities requires an adaptive risk based mitigation scheme to assess the systems state, a secure system architecture that can isolate hardware and software components, and design methods that can adaptively adjust the systems topology based on risk changes. An essential complementary aspect during deployment is detecting, characterizing and quantifying security threats. In this paper, we present a dynamic risk management and mitigation approach based on probabilistic threat estimation. We show a case study of our approach on a smart connected pacemaker. IEEE},

abstract={Defending against cyber criminals, cyber warfare and cyber terrorism all rely on the mitigation of the motivated Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) that carry out such campaigns. Pro-active threat emulation such as penetration testing or red teaming is the preferred means to address these threats especially when compared to reactive solutions which begin their life cycle post-exploitation. These offensive security assessments allow an organization to identify vulnerabilities that could be used by malicious actors. Although many security industry institutions label their products or services as addressing APTs unfortunately there is no agreed upon standard for how to properly do this. Additionally, academic efforts regarding APTs largely focus on monitoring which is reactive or automated assessment, which simulates only known attack sequences and doesn’t necessarily represent future attacks. This paper aims to provide a standard for addressing APT attacks by a new paradigm beginning offensive security assessments as the end goal of the APT and not by focusing on network access. Such an assessment counters the outcome of APT breaches by focusing on vulnerabilities that enable an actor to compromise the data most important to an organization locally and pivoting outwards to points used for access and exfiltration. When an organization identifies the critical items that represent unacceptable losses they should be protected as if an actor, regardless of motivation, were intent on compromising them. Adequate identification and then protection of critical items via offensive assessments originating at such positions represents an approach more efficient and capable of mitigating the overall impact of an APT breach. In a threat landscape with hyper-focused actors it is the responsibility of the security field to provide an equally focused security assessment solution beyond the attack simulations of traditional penetration test or red team engagement. This paper ratifies the validity of such a counter APT assessment paradigm through experimentation as well as case study. This unique combination of academic experimentation and industry implementation provides a proof of concept indicating that this novel approach to addressing advanced cyber threats is worth consideration as an augment to existing cyber security constructs. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

abstract={Existing research on cyber threat assessment focuses on analyzing the network vulnerabilities and producing possible attack graphs. Cyber attacks in real-world enterprise networks, however, vary significantly due to not only network and system configurations, but also the attacker’s strategies. This work proposes a cyber-based attacker behavior model (ABM) in conjunction with the Cyber Attack Scenario and Network Defense Simulator to model the interaction between the network and the attackers. The ABM leverages a knowledge-based design and factors in the capability, opportunity, intent, preference, and Cyber Attack Kill Chain integration to model various types of attackers. By varying the types of attackers and the network configurations, and simulating their interactions, we present a method to measure the overall network security against cyber attackers under different scenarios. Simulation results based on four attacker types on two network configurations are shown to demonstrate how different attacker behaviors may lead to different ways to penetrate a network, and how a single misconfiguration may impact network security. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Automation provides many new and improved abilities for ships and offshore assets. Automation is more than the mere replacement of the functions of older (less optimal) systems; it requires system interoperability and integration. Interconnectivity of multiple systems adds new risk factors to the system as a whole. Two key risk factors are cyber security and system complexity. At a high-level, cybersecurity means understanding your systems and processes, your personnel's capabilities and limitations, as well as thoroughly evaluating your threat landscape. In other words, system owners must have a keen understanding that there will always be new threats to counter, and new technologies to harness. With improvements in cyber security systems, employees are now the preeminent target, thus making them a substantial vulnerability. Through negligence (human error) and malicious acts - including being the victim of phishing/whaling attacks, lost laptops, accidental disclosure of information, and actions of rogue employees account for up to two-thirds of all cyber-related breaches. Industry must be cognizant that added complexity (e.g., system design/arrangement, rules, policies, procedures, etc.,) can decrease an individual's situational awareness and increase the likelihood of human error. A key to effective systems-risk assessment and complexity management lay in understanding cyber safety system designs, and how people interact with those systems. This paper will discuss methods to engineer systems, control system complexity, and how to help mitigate human error, with the goal of creating an efficient and effective cyber security environment. © 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.},

abstract={Many actors are involved in the supply chain processes needed to produce an integrated circuit. Any one of these individuals or groups could make illicit copies of semiconductor IP during their work. In addition, chips could be intentionally compromised during the design process, before they are even manufactured. If placed into the design with sufficient skill, these built-in vulnerabilities would be extremely difficult to detect during testing. Moreover, they could lay dormant, only to be triggered months or years later to disrupt or exfiltrate data from a system containing the compromised chip. This paper primarily reviews the risks posed by design tampering, looks at threat actors and their possible activities, threat models for these activities, and possible mitigations. It assesses the impacts of security composability theory on risk management and practical design, and tries to identify the greatest threat. Our proposal is to contrast Trojan insertion risks at the two ends of the spectrum in early design phase: first at the highest abstraction level, the RTL description, and second at the layout level, in GDSII. A key question for the future is how to develop security architectures that are Trojan tolerant, meaning that other layers of protective controls exist to protect the overall system from malfunctioning at a level commensurate with the risk tolerance of the system.

abstract={Almost all services and most of the traditional services are totally dependent on the digital environment. Few users are aware of the revolutionary nature of modern technology. Most of us automatically rely on cyberworld's functionality and security. However, such a society can be disrupted in many ways. Daily we receive information about vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. Technical evolution opens new ways for people's lives and work, making their lives easier and creating the conditions for a good life. Although the development of the digital world is a positive thing, there is also an other side to the story. Many security threats and threats to systems are associated with the digital society. In a worst case scenario energy system disturbances may paralyze almost everything that is important in a society. The latest challenges for the operating environment comes from heterogeneous telecommunication networks where new devices and systems are seamlessly interconnected. These include the IoT (Internet of Things), D2D (Device-to-Device), M2M (Machine-to-Machine) or V2X (Vehicle to Everything) systems. These systems have expanded into homes, buildings’ automation systems, cars, and into various control and energy systems. Connecting devices to the Internet and their direct interaction saves money and time and improve efficiency. Such an integration process is accelerating at all levels of activity and in each region both horizontally and vertically. This paper describes the changing factors of the future society that affect our daily activities. A short presentation about active nodes is included, which are used in virtualized environments in future networks. A threat assessment for intelligent urban network environments using QFD modelling and Attack Tree-based risk analysis is presented. We use Threat-Driven analytics to find Cyber threats and vulnerabilities. This paper describes a society where all important functions interact with each other through digital networks. The purpose of this paper is to give a technical outlook for infrastructure developers and to the designers of future services about the evolution of society. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc.

abstract={Continuous risk monitoring is considered in the context of cybersecurity management for the Industrial Internet-of-Thing. Cyber-risk management best practice is for security controls to be deployed and configured in order to bring down risk exposure to an acceptable level. However, threats and known vulnerabilities are subject to change, and estimates of risk are subject to many uncertainties, so it is important to review risk assessments and update controls when required. Risks are typically reviewed periodically (e.g. once per month), but the accelerating pace of change means that this approach is not sustainable, and there is a requirement for continuous monitoring of cybersecurity risks. The method described in this paper aims to alert security staff of significant changes or trends in estimated risk exposure to facilitate rational and timely decisions. Additionally, it helps predict the success and impact of a nascent security breach allowing better prioritisation of threats and selection of appropriate responses. The method is illustrated using a scenario based on environmental control in a data centre. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Recent events have shown the vulnerability of IT systems of companies, organizations or even governments to hacker attacks. At the same time, information technologies are becoming increasingly established and important in various industries (digitalization). With a view to the modern development of terrorism, cyber-attacks can be used to physically damage critical infrastructures (CI). This leads to a new dimension of cyber-attacks, which are called terrorist cyber-attacks. The following research contributes to the identification of weak information technology components of railway operating systems and thus improves the safety of public transportation in the context of the European railway traffic management system (ERTMS). The core of this paper is an extended literature research on security flaws in the ERTMS. The future introduction of a methodology for evaluating the criticality of information technology system components will build on this using cyber threats and public transportation as examples. Such a method may serve as a basis for further risk assessments and management measures. © Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management ISCRAM. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The introduction of connected systems and digital technology in process industries creates new cyber-security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by sophisticated threats and lead to undesirable safety accidents. Thus, identifying these vulnerabilities during risk analysis becomes an important part for effective industrial risk evaluation. However, nowadays, safety and security are analyzed separately when they should not be. This is because a security threat can lead to the same dangerous phenomenon as a safety incident. In this paper, a new method that considers safety and security together during industrial risk analysis is proposed. This approach combines bowtie analysis, commonly used for safety analysis, with a new extended version of attack tree analysis, introduced for security analysis of industrial control systems. The combined use of bowtie and attack tree provides an exhaustive representation of risk scenarios in terms of safety and security. We then propose an approach for evaluating the risk level based on two-term likelihood parts, one for safety and one for security. The application of this approach is demonstrated using the case study of a risk scenario in a chemical facility. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to investigate the cyber security awareness and policies within corporate organisations in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches underpinned by questionnaire and document analysis, data were collected from 100 participants centred on cyber security awareness and information policies. Findings: The study underscored that, although corporate organisations had a good knowledge of IT, their awareness of cyber security remains limited. It observed that most organisations in Ghana are not integrating legal aspects into their information security policies. It proposed the need to increase the security awareness of corporate organisation, particularly because of the vulnerabilities they are exposed to. Research limitations/implications: The implication of the paper with respect to theory, practice and future research lies in the recommendations the authors have proffered, such as the implementation of security awareness training programme, need assessment and the outsourcing of qualified service providers. Practical implications: The study is useful for policy makers in the management of Ghana’s IT infrastructure. Originality/value: This study is being undertaken at a period when Ghana has made progressive development and giant steps in the IT industry compared to its counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa. The developed nature of Ghana’s IT infrastructure requires the development of policies for cyber security to prevent data loses and protect the national infrastructure from threats. Undertaking a study on cyber security in an environment where cyber issues are hardly discussed is worthwhile. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Cybercriminal use of the internet continues to grow and poses a serious threat to individuals, businesses and governments. Software vulnerabilities represent a main cause of cybersecurity problems. Every day security engineers deal with a flow of cyber security incidents that are increasing. Effective management of software vulnerabilities is imperative for modern organisations regardless of their size. However, the vulnerability management processes tend to be more reactive in nature; relying on the publication of vulnerabilities, creation of signatures, and the scanning and detection process before control mitigations can be put into place. A forecasting model of the anticipated volume of future disclosures that leverages the rich historical vulnerability data will provide important insights help develop strategies for the proactive management of vulnerabilities. This study is the first to discover the existence of volatility clustering in the vulnerability disclosure trend. Through our novel framework for statistically analysing long-term vulnerability disclosures between January 1999 and January 2016, the result shows that our model can predict the likelihood that software contains yet to be discovered vulnerabilities and be exposed to future threats such as zero-day attacks. Such knowledge could be potentially an important first step in crime detection and prevention and improve security practices. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={For many years, cyber security in both Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian industries has been a compliance driven process. Respective organizations define rules or best practices that direct their Information Technology (IT) systems to comply to. Success is often measured by how well these static rules are followed, and how many security incidents have been discovered compared to historical data. There is a multitude of problems associated with this simplistic approach. First, cyber threats are constantly evolving; it was previously estimated that as many as 400,000 new malware are being introduced each day. Most of these threats are specifically targeting a given system and/or designed to succeed in certain attack vector. Adapting a cookie-cutting, one-size-fits-all cyber security policy that only gets reviewed/updated periodically might not be adequate. From the technical standpoint, even the best commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) anti-virus/anti-malware software relies on regular database updates of known threats. Hence, by definition, these forms of protection can only provide remediation for existing threats; systems are basically defenseless against specific zero-day threats that are specifically designed to attack these systems. A more comprehensive approach toward cyber security should be adapted to defend against these evolving threats. With the pervasive nature of the Internet, previously disparate industries are now more interwoven together than ever before. In the United States, if a cyber attack is to happen in the power grid infrastructure, it is conceivable the impacts could be spread to public safety, health, national defense, banking and finance sectors. Not only might impacts be felt across industries, but the threat profiles of these attacks may hold similarities as well due to common vulnerabilities across IT and Operation Technology (OT) systems. Hence, it is crucial to determine how different industries are addressing the cyber security challenges they are each facing. This paper will provide a brief survey of best practices in cyber security in several industries, including DoD, oil/gas industries and banking/financial institutions. There are many similarities in the way these industries are each approaching the cyber security challenges. At the same time, there are significant differences in the specific threats they are facing. For example, the DoD is beginning to shift its focus from generic penetration tests and risk management framework evaluations to using cyber range testing and simulation-based threat assessment that systematically evaluate military systems and platforms under a variety of operational conditions. The oil/gas energy companies are also starting to identify their most vulnerable systems and subsystem components. For example, they work with industrial control system (ICS) vendors and suppliers to improve their products’ cyber security performance-both at the individual unit level as well as the network protocol layer. The banking and financial institutions are facing cyber attackers with different motivations than those targeting the DoD systems. Instead of crippling or destroying the targeted systems, the cyber criminals in the banking/financial industries are often more focusing on deception and data exfiltration, even though they also use similar tactics, techniques, procedures (TTP) such as phishing, waterhole attack, etc. like the cyber attackers in other industries. Although the aforementioned industries are facing cyber attackers with different motivations, many of the threat vectors and methodologies are actually very similar. Hence, it would be beneficial if cyber experts in these industries could share threat information, and collaborate to define cyber best practices. A complementary approach is to establish a cyber simulation environment that allows individual organizations to provide their threat models, and that these models can be shared across multiple industries. © Winter Simulation Innovation Workshop, SIW 2018.

abstract={Growing demand for reliable energy has advanced smart power grid development which attempts to merge conventional power grid infrastructures with advanced and modern technologies. To achieve this goal, energy providers need to invest in gaining detailed knowledge of cybersecurity to prevent different types of attacks such as false data injection, intrusion, and load redistribution. Cyber threat vectors and existing vulnerabilities in smart grid technologies need to be well understood and protected against. Successful cyberattacks would most likely result in data loss and equipment damage, and in addition, possible life and other intangible economic losses. A reliable smart grid needs strong and resistant cybersecurity protection, which is capable of detecting and diagnosing these attacks. A security risk analysis model can evaluate the potential risks in power system. This risk analysis will help in reducing costs without increasing the need for power system upgrades. This research introduces the cybersecurity model to assess the risk. This paper uses the PCA procedure in SAS 9.4 to conduct MANOVA analysis on a power system data set including the recordings of 4966 observations and 114 features. The main goal of this analysis is to determine whether a rule can be constructed to discriminate between the two classes of natural and attack events. © 2018 Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE).

abstract={Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA) monitor and control industrial and critical infrastructure functions such as electricity, oil, water and natural gas production and distribution processes. Consequently, failure in the intended operation of SCADA system results in catastrophic consequences. With the increased interconnectivity of SCADA systems and the commercial availability of cloud computing, SCADA systems have increasingly adopted Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to significantly reduce infrastructure costs and increase ease of maintenance and integration. As a result, the exposure of these systems to cyber threats has increased enormously. Therefore, there is a necessity to identify, remediate and mitigate system's security vulnerabilities to protect and prevent possible attacks. This study serves two folds; firstly, different types of vulnerabilities in SCADA systems have been identified and reviewed. Secondly, two test cases have been presented to demonstrate the severity of the identified vulnerabilities on SCADA systems. This study draws attention to the impact of threat on SCADA systems and their consequences. © Medwell Journals, 2018.},

abstract={Traditional process hazard analysis (PHA), such as Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies, typically includes a systematic assessment of initiating events and consequences affecting process facilities. Relationships among initiating events, safeguards, and consequences are evaluated in depth, but such evaluation is generally based on unintentional causes such as human error or some unexpected failure of equipment, instrumentation, controls, or safeguards. As the process industry evolves toward greater reliance on and integration with information technology, it is critical to also consider malicious and intentional disruption of process operations by parties who exploit the enhanced capabilities and integration of modern communication with process controls and operations. This paper discusses the significance of considering cybersecurity threats during a PHA/HAZOP. A step-by-step and systematic technique is presented to show how a PHA team could assess the vulnerability of a system or facility to potential cyber threats, analyze adequacy of safeguards, and develop necessary countermeasures to resist cyberattacks. A typical refinery or chemical plant can have thousands of signals that are connected to a Distributed Control System (DCS) to ensure safe and smooth process operation. This arrangement could inadvertently present multiple pathways for malicious parties to intervene by manipulating signals or disrupting communications, potentially leading to severe process hazards and consequences such as a fire, explosion and fatality. Not only does incorporating cybersecurity in a PHA/HAZOP help identify the vulnerability of your system or facility, it could also be used to prioritize limited resources to ensure critical vulnerabilities are mitigated in a timely and efficient manner. The application of this technique will be demonstrated using case examples. © GCPS 2018 .All right reserved.},

abstract={With the enhancement of informatization and automation, the capacity and efficiency of CBTC systems are increasing. However, the wide application of information technologies brings serious security threats on CBTC systems. Due to inherent characteristics of railway services, obtaining the security situation of CBTC systems is necessary. The methodlogy in this paper to evaluate the vulnerability of systems adopts attack tree modelling based on the functional architecture of CBTC systems. Assessments cover the current security states, port auditing, password policies and communication protocols of systems with the advantages of simplicity and operability. Based on the attack tree, leaf vulnerability, scenario vulnerability and system vulnerability are defined. During this assessment process, a typical scan tool, Nessus, and a vulnerability scoring system, CVSS, are used to achieve the port auditing. Moreover, a method to calculate the password strength and a piecewise linear function to normalize password strength are proposed. In the end, this approach is applied to a CBTC test-bed, and the assessment results show the difference of the vulnerability between the system with or without the improved countermeasures. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={IT system risk assessments are indispensable due to increasing cyber threats within our ever-growing IT systems. Moreover, laws and regulations urge organizations to conduct risk assessments regularly. Even though there exist several risk management frameworks and methodologies, they are in general high level, not defining the risk metrics, risk metrics values and the detailed risk assessment formulas for different risk views. To address this need, we define a novel risk assessment methodology specific to IT systems. Our model is quantitative, both asset and vulnerability centric and defines low and high level risk metrics. High level risk metrics are defined in two general categories; base and attack graph-based. In our paper, we provide a detailed explanation of formulations in each category and make our implemented software publicly available for those who are interested in applying the proposed methodology to their IT systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within homes raises many security and privacy concerns. Recent headlines highlight the lack of effective security mechanisms in IoT devices. Security threats in IoT arise not only from vulnerabilities in individual devices but also from the composition of devices in unanticipated ways and the ability of devices to interact through both cyber and physical channels. Existing approaches provide methods for monitoring cyber interactions between devices but fail to consider possible physical interactions. To overcome this challenge, it is essential that security assessments of IoT networks take a holistic view of the network and treat it as a "system of systems", in which security is defined, not solely by the individual systems, but also by the interactions and trust dependencies between systems. In this paper, we propose a way of modeling cyber and physical interactions between IoT devices of a given network. By verifying the cyber and physical interactions against user-defined policies, our model can identify unexpected chains of events that may be harmful. It can also be applied to determine the impact of the addition (or removal) of a device into an existing network with respect to dangerous device interactions. We demonstrate the viability of our approach by instantiating our model using Alloy, a language and tool for relational models. In our evaluation, we considered three realistic IoT use cases and demonstrate that our model is capable of identifying potentially dangerous device interactions. We also measure the performance of our approach with respect to the CPU runtime and memory consumption of the Alloy model finder, and show that it is acceptable for smart-home IoT networks. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The current proliferation of large amounts of multimedia data creates an unprecedented challenge for security analysts in the context of Cyber Situational Awareness. Due to this phenomenal growth of multimedia data, security analysts have to invest enormous time and efforts in filtering and correlating multimedia data in order to make informed decisions about identifying and mitigating threats and vulnerabilities. In particular, analysts have to analyze and interpret diverse multimedia network data with varying contexts in order to find the true evidence of cyber attacks. Considering the multimedia nature of cyber security data, we propose a cloud-assisted recommendation system that can identify and retrieve multimedia data of interest based on contextual information and security analysts’ personal preferences. This recommendation system benefits security analysts by establishing a bridge between their personal preferences, the contextual information of their analytical process, and the various types of modality of multimedia data. Evaluation of the proposed system shows evidence that our multimedia recommendation mechanisms promotes cyber threat understanding and risk assessment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Owing to the high value of business data, sophisticated cyber-attacks targeting enterprise networks have become more prominent, with attackers trying to penetrate deeper into and reach wider from the compromised machines. An important security requirement is that domain experts and network administrators have a common vocabulary to share security knowledge and quickly help each other respond to new threats. We propose an innovative ontology and graph-based approach for security assessment. An ontology is designed to represent security knowledge such as that of assets, vulnerabilities, and attacks in a common form. Using the inference abilities of the ontological model, an efficient system framework is proposed to generate attack graphs and assess network security. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated on test networks of differing sizes and topologies. © 2017},

abstract={The digitalization of the instrumentation and control (I&C) systems in nuclear power plants has increased the threat from cyber-attack. This paper addresses cyber-attack vulnerability from potential attacks on non-safety I&C systems that result in a hazardous plant status. In safety-critical applications such as nuclear power plants, safety systems are separated and isolated from non-safety systems by design. Cyber-attacks on the non-safety systems can however escalate into plant safety threats by inducing wrong operator actions. We focus here on the operator actions that lead to the unavailability of the safety system and cause the failure of accident mitigation. In this study, the effect of safety system unavailability on plant safety is carefully modeled by using n conventional fault tree (FT) analyses, and human actions are analyzed based on emergency operating procedures. Based on the results of the FT analyses in combination with human action analyses, we suggest a novel method to systematically develop cyber-attack propagation scenarios, where a cyber-attack is linked to its consequences. As a case study, the feed-and-bleed operation is analyzed with the developed FT, producing multiple scenarios that lead to core damage. The results of this study are expected to be useful in establishing preventive measures © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Automated cyber security configuration synthesis is the holy grail of cyber risk management. The effectiveness of cyber security is highly dependent on the appropriate configuration hardening of heterogeneous, yet interdependent, network security devices, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, IPSec gateways, and proxies, to minimize cyber risk. However, determining cost-effective security configuration for risk mitigation is a complex decision-making process because it requires considering many different factors including end-hosts’ security weaknesses based on compliance checking, threat exposure due to network connectivity, potential impact/damage, service reachability requirements according to business polices, acceptable usability due to security hardness, and budgetary constraints. Although many automated techniques and tools have been proposed to scan end-host vulnerabilities and verify the policy compliance, existing approaches lack metrics and analytics to identify fine-grained network access control based on comprehensive risk analysis using both the hosts’ compliance reports and network connectivity. In this paper, we present new metrics and a formal framework for automatically assessing the global enterprise risk and determining the most cost-effective security configuration for risk mitigation considering both the end-host security compliance and network connectivity. Our proposed metrics measure the global enterprise risk based on the end-host vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses, collected through compliance scanning reports, their inter-dependencies, and network reachability. We then use these metrics to automatically generate a set of host-based vulnerability fixes and network access control decisions that mitigates the global network risk to satisfy the desired Return on Investment of cyber security. We solve the problem of cyber risk mitigation based on advanced formal methods using Satisfiability Module Theories, which has shown scalability with large-size networks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) represent a fundamental link between information technology (IT) systems and the devices that control industrial production and maintain critical infrastructure services that support our modern world. Increasingly, the interconnections among CPS and IT systems have created exploitable security vulnerabilities due to a number of factors, including a legacy of weak information security applications on CPS and the tendency of CPS operators to prioritize operational availability at the expense of integrity and confidentiality. As a result, CPS are subject to a number of threats from cyber attackers and cyber-physical attackers, including denial of service and even attacks against the integrity of the data in the system. The effects of these attacks extend beyond mere loss of data or the inability to access information system services. Attacks against CPS can cause physical damage in the real world. This paper reviews the challenges of providing information assurance services for CPS that operate critical infrastructure systems and industrial control systems. These methods are thorough measures to close integrity and confidentiality gaps in CPS and processes to highlight the security risks that remain. This paper also outlines approaches to reduce the overhead and complexity for security methods, as well as examine novel approaches, including covert communications channels, to increase CPS security. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The authors introduce and explain core concepts of cybersecurity through six engaging practical scenarios. Presented as case studies, the scenarios illustrate how experts may reason through security challenges managing trust and information in the adversarial cyber world. The concepts revolve around adversarial thinking, including understanding the adversary; defining security goals; identifying targets, vulnerabilities, threats, and risks; and devising defenses. They also include dealing with confidentiality, integrity, availability (known as the “CIA triad”), authentication, key management, physical security, and social engineering. The authors hope that these scenarios will inspire students to explore this vital area more deeply. The target audience is anyone who is interested in learningabout cybersecurity, including those with little to no background in cybersecurity. This article will also interest those who teach cybersecurity and are seeking examples and structures for explaining its concepts. For students and educators, the authors include selected misconceptions they observed in student responses to scenarios. The contributions are novel educational case studies, not original technical research. The scenarios comprise responding to an e-mail about lost luggage containing specifications of a new product, delivering packages by drones, explaining a suspicious database input error, designing a corporate network that separates public and private segments, verifying compliance with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and exfiltrating a USB stick from a top-secret government facility. © 2017 Taylor & Francis},

abstract={Recent cyber attacks provide evidence of increased threats to our critical systems and infrastructure. A common reaction to a new threat is to harden the system by adding new rules and regulations. As federal and state governments request new procedures to follow, each of their organizations implements their own cyber defense strategies. This unintentionally increases time and effort that employees spend on training and policy implementation and decreases the time and latitude to perform critical job functions, thus raising overall levels of stress. People's performance under stress, coupled with an overabundance of information, results in even more vulnerabilities for adversaries to exploit. In this article, we embed a simple regulatory model that accounts for cybersecurity human factors and an organization's regulatory environment in a model of a corporate cyber network under attack. The resulting model demonstrates the effect of under- and overregulation on an organization's resilience with respect to insider threats. Currently, there is a tendency to use ad-hoc approaches to account for human factors rather than to incorporate them into cyber resilience modeling. It is clear that using a systematic approach utilizing behavioral science, which already exists in cyber resilience assessment, would provide a more holistic view for decisionmakers. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis},

abstract={Cyber-attacks and intrusions in cyber-physical control systems are, currently, difficult to reliably prevent. Knowing a system's vulnerabilities and implementing static mitigations is not enough, since threats are advancing faster than the pace at which static cyber solutions can counteract. Accordingly, the practice of cybersecurity needs to ensure that intrusion and compromise do not result in system or environment damage or loss. In a previous paper [2], we described the Cyberspace Security Econometrics System (CSES), which is a stakeholder-aware and economics-based risk assessment method for cybersecurity. CSES allows an analyst to assess a system in terms of estimated loss resulting from security breakdowns. In this paper, we describe two new related contributions: 1) We map the Cyberspace Security Econometrics System (CSES) method to the evaluation and mitigation steps described by the NIST Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, Special Publication 800-82r2. Hence, presenting an economics-based and stakeholder-aware risk evaluation method for the implementation of the NIST-SP-800-82 guide; and 2) We describe the application of this tailored method through the use of a fictitious example of a critical infrastructure system of an electric and gas utility. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Health data is important as it provides an individual with knowledge of the factors needed to be improved for oneself. The development of fitness trackers and their associated software aid consumers to understand the manner in which they may improve their physical wellness. These devices are capable of collecting health data for a consumer such sleeping patterns, heart rate readings or the number of steps taken by an individual. Although, this information is very beneficial to guide a consumer to a better healthier state, it has been identified that they have privacy and security concerns. Privacy and Security are of great concern for fitness trackers and their associated applications as protecting health data is of critical importance. This is so, as health data is one of the highly sort after information by cyber criminals. Fitness trackers and their associated applications have been identified to contain privacy and security concerns that places the health data of consumers at risk to intruders. As the study of Consumer Health continues to grow it is vital to understand the elements that are needed to better protect the health information of a consumer. This research paper therefore provides a conceptual threat assessment framework that can be used to identify the elements needed to better secure Consumer Health Wearables. These elements consist of six core elements from the CIA triad and Microsoft STRIDE framework. Fourteen vulnerabilities were further discovered that were classified within these six core elements. Through this, better guidance can be achieved to improve the privacy and security of Consumer Health Wearables. © 2017 IEEE.},

We present a cloud architecture reference model that incorporates a wide range of security controls and best practices, and a cloud security assessment model - Cloud-Trust - that estimates high level security metrics to quantify the degree of confidentiality and integrity offered by a CCS or cloud service provider (CSP). Cloud-Trust is used to assess the security level of four multi-tenant IaaS cloud architectures equipped with alternative cloud security controls. Results show the probability of CCS penetration (high value data compromise) is high if a minimal set of security controls are implemented. CCS penetration probability drops substantially if a cloud defense in depth security architecture is adopted that protects virtual machine (VM) images at rest, strengthens CSP and cloud tenant system administrator access controls, and which employs other network security controls to minimize cloud network surveillance and discovery of live VMs. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The contribution of this paper is to study online systems weaknesses and their relationships to relative cyber-attacks such as data breach against SWIFT network in online banking to ensure the effectiveness of the risk management process. The relationships developed in this study are identified by highlighting the latest incidents globally in online banking and discovering new approaches that the attacker can use against common vulnerabilities such as mobile malware and code injection in banking channels causing massive loss of bank's assets values. Additionally, this research analyzes Online Banking security practices that can be a backdoor for serious incidents and highlights risk management process. The goal is to provide a review of major risks including security risks, compliance risk and operational risk that have been developed in online banking. Also, the study reviews threat methodologies that attacker has been followed in recent years. As a result, the research shows that most dangerous attacks came particularly from one vulnerability that was disregard and handled without appropriate strategies; and provides guidance on risk monitoring and assessment in Online systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet is an open networked system containing much inherent vulnerability, especially around the implementation and management of the services that run there. Application owners and service providers require automated deployment time security in order to protect the services that will be exposed to public and private networks. At the moment, manual intervention is required causing a period of vulnerability to these exposed services. The topic of the paper is how better to address this vulnerable period with automated solutions. We want cloud deployments to be secure from cyber attack as quickly as possible during the transition from deployment to a runtime environment without the need for manual intervention. Commonly, current practice involves making services live and undertaken reactive security measures manually, resulting in costly cyber security breaches. There is an identifiable cyber security issue highlighting the lack of deployment time security automation. The problem is addressed, solvable and we suggest a potential solution. A solution is proposed and claimed as the most effective approach in comparison to other options. This entails implementing all required security measures to an application and its container in an automated way at the point of deployment. The contribution of the paper therefore is to identify how today's cyber threats are potentially serious in particular to newly deployed applications in a cloud space. Subsequently, an elegant solution is put forward involving automated techniques to protect an application both inside and outside the application container. The solution consists of a vulnerability assessment of the system containing the application, the creation of an automatic firewall perimeter and automatically patching applications against vulnerabilities. This is an approach based on prevention rather than detection. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficient analysis of shared Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) information is crucial for network risk assessment and security hardening. There is a growing interest in implementing a proactive line of defense through threat profiling. However, determining the resiliency of a particular network with respect to relevant threats reported in CTI shared data remains a challenge, largely due to the lack of semantics and contextual information present in textual representations of the threat knowledge. To overcome the limitations of existing CTI frameworks, we devise a threat analytics framework based on Web Ontology Language (OWL) for formal specification, semantic reasoning, and contextual analysis, allowing the derivation of network associated threats from large volumes of shared threat feeds. Our ontology represents constructs of Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) with the additional concepts of Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX), network configurations, and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) for risk analysis and threat actor profiling. The framework provides an automated mechanism to investigate cyber threats targeting the network under question by classifying the threat relevance, determining threat likelihood, identifying the affected and exposed assets through formulated rules and inferences. We perform a comprehensive structural and conceptual evaluation of critical advanced persistent threats (APTs) collected from credible sources and determine their relevance and risk posed to realistic network case studies. Finally we show that the proposed framework is novel in the type of analytics it provides and outperforms other competing approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The SCADA infrastructure is a key component for power grid operations. Securing the SCADA infrastructure against cyber intrusions is thus vital for a well-functioning power grid. However, the task remains a particular challenge, not the least since not all available security mechanisms are easily deployable in these reliability-critical and complex, multi-vendor environments that host modern systems alongside legacy ones, to support a range of sensitive power grid operations. This paper examines how effective a few countermeasures are likely to be in SCADA environments, including those that are commonly considered out of bounds. The results show that granular network segmentation is a particularly effective countermeasure, followed by frequent patching of systems (which is unfortunately still difficult to date). The results also show that the enforcement of a password policy and restrictive network configuration including whitelisting of devices contributes to increased security, though best in combination with granular network segmentation. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMSs) provide an essential building block for Smart Grid supervision and control. Distributed Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) allow accurate clock-synchronized measurements of voltage and current phasors (amplitudes, phase angles) and frequencies. The sensor data from PMUs provide situational awareness in the grid, and are used as input for control decisions. A modification of sensor data can severely impact grid stability, overall power supply, and physical devices. Since power grids are critical infrastructures, WAMSs are tempting targets for all kinds of attackers, including well-organized and motivated adversaries such as terrorist groups or adversarial nation states. Such groups possess sufficient resources to launch sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of attack possibilities on WAMSs. We model the dependencies and building blocks of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) on WAMSs using attack trees. We consider the whole WAMS infrastructure, including aggregation and data collection points, such as Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs), classical IT components, and clock synchronization. Since Smart Grids are cyber-physical systems, we consider physical perturbations, in addition to cyber attacks in our models. The models provide valuable information about the chain of cyber or physical attack steps that can be combined to build a sophisticated attack for reaching a higher goal. They assist in the assessment of physical and cyber vulnerabilities, and provide strategic guidance for the deployment of suitable countermeasures. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Virtually every connected system will be attacked sooner or later. This holds specifically for cloud-based services and systems. A 100% secure solution is not feasible. Therefore, advanced risk assessment and mitigation is the order of the day. Risk-oriented security engineering helps in both designing for robust systems as well as effective mitigation upon attacks or exploits of vulnerabilities. Security must be integrated early in the design phase to understand the threats and risks to expected functionality. The security analysis provides requirements and respective test vectors so that adequate measures can be derived for balancing security costs and efforts. This book chapter provides experience and guidance concerning how information security can be successfully achieved with a security requirements engineering perspective. Our experiences from embedded security in critical IT systems show that security is only successful with a systematic understanding and handling of security requirements and their interaction with functional requirements. Four requirements engineering-related levers for achieving security are addressed: Security requirements elicitation, security analysis, security design, and security validation. We will show for each of these levers how security is analyzed and implemented. A case study from automotive systems will highlight concrete best practices. Only systematic and disciplined security requirements engineering will ensure that security needs are met end to end from concept to architecture to verification and test and-most relevant-operations, service, and maintenance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Context Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have emerged to be the next generation of engineered systems driving the so-called fourth industrial revolution. CPSs are becoming more complex, open and more prone to security threats, which urges security to be engineered systematically into CPSs. Model-Based Security Engineering (MBSE) could be a key means to tackle this challenge via security by design, abstraction, and automation. Objective We aim at providing an initial assessment of the state of the art in MBSE for CPSs (MBSE4CPS). Specifically, this work focuses on finding out 1) the publication statistics of MBSE4CPS studies; 2) the characteristics of MBSE4CPS studies; and 3) the open issues of MBSE4CPS research. Method We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) following a rigorous protocol that was developed based on the state-of-the-art SMS and systematic review guidelines. From thousands of relevant publications, we systematically identified 48 primary MBSE4CPS studies for data extraction and synthesis to answer predefined research questions. Results SMS results show that for three recent years (2014–2016) the number of primary MBSE4CPS studies has increased significantly. Within the primary studies, the popularity of using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is comparable with the use of the standardised UML modelling notation. Most primary studies do not explicitly address specific security concerns (e.g., confidentiality, integrity) but rather focus on security analyses in general on threats, attacks or vulnerabilities. Few primary studies propose to engineer security solutions for CPSs. Many focus on the early stages of development lifecycle such as security requirement engineering or analysis. Conclusion The SMS does not only provide the state of the art in MBSE4CPS, but also points out several open issues that would deserve more investigation, e.g., the lack of engineering security solutions for CPSs, limited tool support, too few industrial case studies, and the challenge of bridging DSLs in engineering secure CPSs. © 2016},

abstract={Organizations rely on security experts to improve the security of their systems. These professionals use background knowledge and experience to align known threats and vulnerabilities before selecting mitigation options. The substantial depth of expertise in any one area (e.g., databases, networks, operating systems) precludes the possibility that an expert would have complete knowledge about all threats and vulnerabilities. To begin addressing this problem of fragmented knowledge, we investigate the challenge of developing a security requirements rule base that mimics multi-human expert reasoning to enable new decision-support systems. In this paper, we show how to collect relevant information from cyber security experts to enable the generation of: (1) interval type-2 fuzzy sets that capture intra- and inter-expert uncertainty around vulnerability levels; and (2) fuzzy logic rules driving the decision-making process within the requirements analysis. The proposed method relies on comparative ratings of security requirements in the context of concrete vignettes, providing a novel, interdisciplinary approach to knowledge generation for fuzzy logic systems. The paper presents an initial evaluation of the proposed approach through 52 scenarios with 13 experts to compare their assessments to those of the fuzzy logic decision support system. The results show that the system provides reliable assessments to the security analysts, in particular, generating more conservative assessments in 19% of the test scenarios compared to the experts' ratings. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Medical devices are complex cyber-physical systems incorporating emergent hardware and software components. However, this complexity leads to a wide attack surface posing security risks and vulnerabilities. Mitigation and management of such risks during premarket design and postmarket deployment are required. Dynamically mitigating threat potential in the presence of unknown vulnerabilities requires an adaptive risk-based scheme to assess the system's state, a secure system architecture that can isolate hardware and software components, and design methods that can adaptively adjust the system's topology based on risk changes. The essential complementary aspects during deployment are detecting, characterizing, and quantifying security threats. This article presents a dynamic risk management and mitigation approach based on probabilistic threat estimation. A smart-connected-pacemaker case study illustrates the approach.

abstract={Nowadays, there is an ever-growing need to investigate, consult and communicate through the internet. This need leads to the intensification of free access to the web in strategic and functional points for the benefit of the community. However, this open access is also related to the increase of information insecurity. The existing works on computer security primarily focus on the development of techniques to reduce cyber-attacks. However, these approaches do not address the sector of inexperienced users who have difficulty understanding browser settings. Two methods can solve this problem: first the development of friendly browsers with intuitive setups for new users and on the other hand, by implementing awareness programs on essential security without deepening on technical information. This article addresses an analysis of the vulnerabilities of wireless equipment that provides internet service in the open access zones and the potential risks that could be found when using these means. © 2017 SPIE.},

abstract={As safety-critical systems increasingly rely on computing, communication, and control, there have been a number of safety and security co-analysis methods put forth to identify, assess, and mitigate risks. However, there is an ideological gap between qualitative system-level methods that focus on control interactions, and more traditional methods based on component failure and/or vulnerability. The growing complexity of cyber-physical and socio-technical systems as well as their interactions with their environments seem to demand a systems-theoretic perspective. Yet, at the same time, more complex threats and failure modes imply a greater need for risk-based analysis to understand and prioritize the large volume of information. In this work we identify promising aspects from two existing safety/security co-analysis methods and outline a vision for reconciling them in a new analysis method. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Software reliability and cybersecurity are critical to system integrity. Security violations in defense systems are an especially grave threat to national security and the focus of significant resources. Major defense acquisition programs (MDAP) are those that meet or exceed Acquisition Category One (ACAT I), which is determined by a cost estimate in excess of hundreds of millions of dollars. Inadequate cybersecurity has contributed to at least one MDAP declaring a Nunn-McCurdy Breach, which requires (i) Congress be notified when the cost per unit increases more than 25% beyond what was originally estimated and (ii) program termination for cost growth greater than 50%. Achieving cybersecurity cost effectively is therefore critical to the national defense and economic well-being of the United States. This paper presents an open source tool to support the quantitative assessment of software reliability and cybersecurity as well as the underlying mathematical theory and algorithmic details. The tool enables assessment of a system's security from penetration testing data and can be used to estimate the number of vulnerabilities remaining within the software as well as the additional penetration testing required to reduce the rate of vulnerability exploitation to a desired level with a specified level of confidence. This top down approach can be applied to systems such as vehicles as well as information systems, including those that must safeguard defense facilities, their contractors, and other government buildings. This approach will enable organizations that acquire software to establish quantitative requirements that can be included in contracts, providing clear thresholds for software and system developers to achieve. The tool will enable contractors to regularly assess the security of their software with respect to requirements, thereby facilitating the identification and reporting of programs that may fail to achieve contractually specified security objectives. This regular assessment and reporting will enable closer collaboration between government agencies and contractors to ensure that systems achieve a desired level of security to reduce the risk of cost and schedule overruns that would otherwise threaten deployment of secure systems.},

The main focus of this study is to evaluate and parameterize these metrics using simulations of flow-level models of the airspace system, together with some formal analysis.

abstract={Accurate measurement of the quality of systems is crucial to building trustworthy systems. Such a measurement indicates whether a system is working properly and meeting its requirements. Although security and dependability metrics are regarded as key metrics for measuring the quality of systems, they are not sufficient for measuring the quality of systems that are placed in a multi-domain environment including hardware, software, network, human factors, and physical environments. In order to embrace multidimensional aspects of the quality of a system, we introduce a trustworthiness metric framework that supports three key submetrics of trust, resilience, and agility, and propose an ontology-based framework with three corresponding sub-ontologies. We also discuss how the key metrics are related to the severity of threats and the quality of assessment tools.

abstract={Integrated Modular Communication (IMC) is an on-board platform to provide secure and reliable aircraft communications for a diverse set of applications. IMC is viewed as an important part of the future Air Traffic Management (ATM) infrastructure. Integrating communication links and combining diverse applications in a single platform (IMC) do come with some risks to the ATM communications that could potentially increase vulnerabilities and make the system more prone to security attacks. There are several types of attacks on network communications such as disrupting or blocking communication, intercepting, injecting fabricated packets, accessing and modifying the information. In this study, the Security Risk Assessment Methodology (SecRAM) is applied to IMC for identifying runtime threats, assessing the risks involved, and defining measures to mitigate them. The risk assessment is performed to evaluate the impact and likelihood of occurrence of attacks relevant to the identified threats and the resulting risk levels. Consequently, specific mitigation measures as IMC's security controls are proposed to provide cyber resiliency for the IMC. The IMC security controls will be validated in an emulated testbed environment in the GAMMA project. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Critical infrastructures are vital assets for the public safety, economic welfare and national security of countries. Cyber systems are used extensively to monitor and control critical infrastructures. A number of infrastructures are connected to the Internet via corporate networks. Cyber security is, therefore, an important item of the national security agenda of a country. The intense interest in cyber security has initiated research focusing on national cyber security maturity assessments. However, little, if any, research is dedicated to maturity assessments of national critical infrastructure protection efforts. Instead, the vast majority of studies merely examine diverse national-level security best practices ranging from cyber crime response to privacy protection. This paper proposes a maturity model for measuring the readiness levels of national critical infrastructure protection efforts. The development of the model involves two steps. The first step analyzes data pertaining to national cyber security projects using grounded theory to extract the root causes of the susceptibility of critical infrastructures to cyber threats. The second step determines the maturity criteria by introducing the root causes to subject-matter experts polled in a Delphi survey. The resulting survey-based maturity model is applied to assess the critical infrastructure protection efforts in Turkey. The results are realistic and intuitively appealing, demonstrating that the maturity model is useful for evaluating the national critical infrastructure protection preparedness of developing countries such as Turkey. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In a sophisticated and coordinated cyber-attack $100 million has been stolen from Bangladesh's account. Attackers introduced malicious code remotely into the Bangladesh Bank's server, which allowed them to process and authorize the transactions. Advanced attack techniques poses threats to all web application systems. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) are two vulnerabilities which have techniques that are similar to those of the Bangladesh Bank heist. XSS and CSRF are third and eighth of the top ten web application vulnerabilities on OWASP list from 2013 till now. Both these attacks violate the users trust for the websites and web browsers. Because of the severity of these vulnerabilities, security specialists have always shared their concern and warned the web developers. Yet Bangladesh government's and developers' reluctance to address the severity of the attacks resulted in Bangladesh Bank heist. In this paper, we aim to study and conduct an investigation of the vulnerabilities of similar attacks as these of the Bangladesh Bank heist on web applications of Bangladesh. We would focus on XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities due to their high ranking on the OWASP list.

abstract={Numerous security concerns exist in smart home systems in which Internet of Things devices are connected through a home network to enable control using a centralised gateway with a handset device from the Internet. Safeguarding personal information privacy is an increasing concern in smart living services. To guarantee the mobile security of smart living services, security managers use taint checking approaches with dynamic taint propagation analysis operations to examine how a software-defined networking app uses sensitive information and investigate suspicious security vulnerabilities of devices and the effects of the spread of taint propagation over the Internet by identifying taint paths. For solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem, most approaches focus on cloud computing applications (apps) with malware threat analysis that involves program vulnerability analyses, rather than on the risk posed by suspicious apps connected to the cloud computing server. Accordingly, this article proposes a taint propagation analysis model incorporating a weighted spanning tree analysis scheme for tracking data with taint marking using several taint checking tools with an open software-defined networking architecture for solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem. In the proposed model, Android programs perform dynamic taint propagation to analyse the spread of risks posed by suspicious apps connected to the centralised gateway in a smart home system. In probabilistic risk analysis, risk and defence capability are used for each taint path to assist a defender in recognising the attack results against network threats caused by malware infection and to estimate the losses of associated taint sources. A case of threat analysis of a typical cyber security attack is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. A new approach was used for verifying the details of an attack sequence for malware infection by incorporating a finite state machine to appropriately represent the real dynamic taint propagation analysis situations at various configuration settings and safeguard deployment. The experimental results proved that the threat analysis model enables a defender to convert the spread of taint propagation to loss and estimate the risk of a specific threat using behavioural analysis associated with 60 families of real malware. Consequently, our scheme was significantly effective in predicting the risk and loss of tainted data propagation for security concerns in smart home systems when the number of taint paths associated with the propagation rules discovered through taint analysis was increased. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={The crisis of insecure software has resulted in a drastic increase in the frequency and impact of cyber attacks on businesses and individual users alike. The discipline of secure software engineering has evolved as a response to this trend, with the aim of producing software with fewer coding bugs or design flaws that result in exploitable vulnerabilities. However, secure software engineering is a young discipline, and many software artifacts in current use were created before, or in ignorance of, its development. Software practitioners would benefit greatly from a rigorous methodology for analyzing and validating software that has already entered its maintenance lifecycle. In this paper, we present a combined penetrating testing methodology that incorporates strengths of several existing approaches, with the goal to understand their utility and benefit for analyzing security of existing software programs. We exercise this methodology through a case study applied to a popular tool used by many network security practitioners: Wireshark. As a contribution, our study illustrates the benefits of a combined approach and outlines recommendations for a holistic method that will improve security-based risk assessment. Specifically, we show how application of rigorous test-driven threat modeling can produce better abuse cases, which can in turn be used to inform and more precisely define penetration testing activities. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Considering the increasing deployment of the Internet and information systems together with providing various services through web applications, the related risks and threats in this field are also skyrocketing. In recent years several different websites such as online shops, portals, and governmental sites were subject to penetrations attacks and illegal hacking activities. The mentioned intrusions have often resulted in significant financial and credibility losses together with endangering organizational and even national interests. Given the magnitude and complexity of cyber-attacks and due to the diversity of the web application's structure, the need to have a comprehensive and effective solution to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of such attacks is imperative. Taking into account the nature of the Internet and the necessity of websites availability 24 hours a day from all parts of the globe, it is ideal and can be taken as an advantage, but it should be also noted that this feature, considering the absence of appropriate security, can lead to some main ways for targeting and attacking web applications. One of the newest tools to prevent infiltration and attacks on websites, are web application-specific firewalls or the Web Application Firewalls (WAF) by which security policies can be applied among end users and web applications. In this paper this feature has been implemented in software for protection and provides the advantage of preserving the security in web applications against attacks and methods which affect the system together through a comparative approach. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are under modernization towards increasing efficiency, reliability, and controllability. Despite the numerous benefits of interconnecting ICS components, the wide adoption of Information Technologies (IT) has introduced new security challenges and vulnerabilities to industrial processes, previously obscured by the systems' custom designs. Towards securing the backbone of critical infrastructure, selection of the proper assessment environment for performing cyber-security assessments is crucial. In this paper, we present a layered analysis of vulnerabilities and threats in ICS components, that identifies the need for including real hardware components in the assessment environment. Moreover, we advocate the suitability of Hardware-In-The-Loop testbeds for ICS cyber-security assessment and present their advantages over other assessment environments. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Modern computer networks generate significant volume of behavioural system logs on a daily basis. Such networks comprise many computers with Internet connectivity, and many users who access the Web and utilise Cloud services make use of numerous devices connected to the network on an ad-hoc basis. Measuring the risk of cyber attacks and identifying the most recent modus-operandi of cyber criminals on large computer networks can be difficult due to the wide range of services and applications running within the network, the multiple vulnerabilities associated with each application, the severity associated with each vulnerability, and the ever-changing attack vector of cyber criminals. In this paper we propose a framework to represent these features, enabling real-time network enumeration and traffic analysis to be carried out, in order to produce quantified measures of risk at specific points in time. We validate the approach using data from a University network, with a data collection consisting of 462,787 instances representing threats measured over a 144 hour period. Our analysis can be generalised to a variety of other contexts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Most information attacks come from the Internet these days; they spread through networks of different types and extensions. The quantity of malware of a size of several hundred millions require more and more refined and complex solutions and tools of protection. The products sold as virus protection programs in the 80s have become complex systems by today. The situation is made even more difficult by the fact that the continually appearing threats are active for a very short time only-for 2-3 hours or a few days. The multilevel protection systems provide protection of the computers in diverse user situations. The continuous development and complexity of the operation systems, the applications running on them, the forms and possibilities of attacks taking advantage of them and the protection solutions result in the fact that the users of computers are not aware of what sources of danger are threatening their machines and what the protection systems are capable of and to what extent they can protect the IT systems from the attacks. The independent testers specialized in the investigation of protection systems assess the protection solutions only but they can hardly answer the question to what extent the set of the protection systems used by the user can protect the infrastructure of the user against cyber-attacks. In this paper the possibilities how antimalware testing industry can provide more valuable and usable information for the protection of IT infrastructures are discussed. In order to do this we need to rise above the assessment of the protection systems and examine the vulnerability and protection of an infrastructure. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Risk management is widely used in order to evaluate and treat prominent risks for organizations. Such models are rather organizational (business-aware) than technical, and enable security officers to manage risks on the long run. However, both ICT systems and threat landscape do not cease to evolve, and dynamic cyber security management becomes paramount to address potential breaches. The operational security management is based on technical processes, executed by administrators who are not necessarily aware of organization's business and strategic aspects. This gap between technical and organizational levels renders traditional risks assessment methods cumbersome and obsolete. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of Elementary Risk (ER) that represents a quantum of risk for an organization. Composite Risks (CRs) are then calculated and presented for the security officer. CR enables dynamic calculation of organizational risk posture while considering the system's state. Moreover, ER and CR enable capture the contribution of technical elements (e.g. vulnerability, server) or security measures (e.g. patch, firewall rule) to the overall risk profile of the organization. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={As cyber physical systems are used more extensively and thoroughly, cyber-attacks have become one of the utmost threats to the cybersecurity of cyber physical systems (CPS). It is possible that an adversary can damage a physical component with cyber-attacks (eg. The Stuxnet). Although many research has been done on risk assessment method, limited work has been published to quantify cybersecurity risk of CPS. This paper suggests a method to quantify the cybersecurity risk of CPS caused by cyber-attacks in terms of numeric value. To help quantitatively measure the risk, we present two indices, the successful-attack-probability index and the attack-impact index, based on vulnerability dependency graph. Furthermore, the successful-attack-probability index is calculated considering the interdependent relationship between vulnerabilities and the calculation of attack-impact index takes the impact on the physical domain resulting from cyber-attacks into account. Numerical example shows that the potential risk of system and the optimal attack target can be obtained. The proposed method can be extended to security investment analysis as well. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The Common Risk Model for Dams (CRM-D), developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in collaboration with the Institute for Defense Analyses and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, is a consistent, mathematically rigorous, and easy to implement method for security risk assessment of dams, navigation locks, hydropower projects, and appurtenant structures. The methodology provides a systematic approach for independently evaluating /physical and cyber security risks across a portfolio of dams, and informing decisions on how to mitigate those risks. The CRM-D can effectively quantify the benefits of implementing a particular risk mitigation strategy and, consequently, enable return-on-investment analyses for multiple physical and cyber security risk mitigation alternatives and facilitate their implementation across a portfolio of dams. The security posture of critical assets within each facility is characterized using generic security configurations associated with the target. Vulnerability estimates, defined as probabilities of successful attack, are elicited from subject-matter experts for a set of attack vectors against generic security configurations at a dam project. Elicitation is conducted separately for different types of adversary. Vulnerability can be estimated for an attack on a target protected by any combination of generic security configurations. Vulnerability estimates are combined with consequence estimates to calculate a risk value for each attack, conditional on it being selected by adversaries. A decision metric, referred to as exposure, is used to aggregate conditional risk estimates across scenarios. This facilitates the comparison of risks by attack type, by target component, or by any set of scenario conditions. The CRM-D methodology also incorporates an adversary decision model that allows estimating threat, expressed as the probabilities of attack scenarios given one of the scenarios in the set is chosen. The adversary decision model, which is based on analysis techniques commonly applied in market research, constitutes a unique contribution to the methods of eliciting expert opinions and uncertainty about intent and capabilities of adversaries. Threat estimates can be combined with consequence and vulnerability estimates to produce estimates of risk for individual attack scenarios, as well as the portfolio as a whole. A cybersecurity risk model to facilitate high-level risk assessments of industrial control systems used to control dam critical functions is also being implemented. The cyber security system architecture and existing defenses at the dam are characterized and used to establish a qualitative cyber vulnerability rating. Vulnerability and consequence estimates are combined to produce conditional risks and facilitate the identification of those projects where stronger cyber-security measures should be implemented to reduce cyber risks to acceptable levels.},

abstract={Space missions are supported on the ground by large, complex system consisting of several interconnected and interdependent cyber components such as servers, routers, switches, and applications. Cyber attacks against the underlying cyber components have the potential to ultimately affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of high-level missions. A fundamental challenge for system designers and decision-makers in such complex, mission-critical environments is understanding how low-level cyber events propagate through the underlying interconnected and interdependent system to impact high-level mission objectives. We present a novel model-based, mission-centric approach to perform cyber security assessments for evaluating the impact of low-level cyber events on high-level mission objectives. Traditional approaches to cyber-security assessment can be broadly classified as either threat-centric, where the focus is on modeling threat behavior, or system-centric, where the focus is on modeling system behavior, and consequences of attacks. We present a hybrid approach, in which we first build a multi-layered model of the cyber system, and model threats to the system via generic attack trees. Then, by incorporating specific vulnerability information about the nodes in the system, our approach allows us to visualize the propagation of multiple threat behaviors through the system model. This enables a more comprehensive assessment of the cyber risk to the high-level mission objectives. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach using a system model and attack trees specific to the command-and-control system of a spacecraft. Specifically, we demonstrate how our approach enables a decision-maker to assess the security posture of the system, identify necessary mitigations and prioritize their deployment. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

abstract={A network modeling paradigm is developed for assessing the impact of cyber threats and failures on traffic flows across the National Airspace System. Specifically, a layered model is envisioned with: 1) flow/queueing model for traffic, 2) stochastic automaton-based model for weather impact, and 3) a percolation model for disruption of information resources provided by the cyber system. The traffic and weather models, which were developed in previous work, are briefly reviewed and the probabilistic cyber- disruption model is introduced in detail. A linearization of the layered model is also constructed, and used to formulate the threat-assessment problem from a network-controls viewpoint. This formulation is used to develop a simple graph-theoretic algorithm for determining vulnerabilities of traffic flows to possible disruptions, and to compute overall vulnerability of the traffic network to cyber disruptions. These results are validated in a small-scale case study. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Risk assessment is a demanding process of information security risk management. Organizations often do not employ sufficiently experienced and qualified employees in handling information security risks. This paper focuses on a fuzzy logic application in the process of information security risk assessment based on a matrix method of the ISO/IEC 27005 standard and regulations according to the Cyber Security Regulation No. 316/2014 introduced in the Czech Republic. The method and the regulations are combined to form a risk assessment matrix which is processed in the QtFuzzyLite software. The result is a fuzzy logic system designed for organizations that need to simplify and specify risk assessment where likelihood of threat occurrence, threat consequence value and asset vulnerability level are vague and difficult to estimate. These variables directly affect the information security risk value. The paper discusses the possibility of utilizing the fuzzy logic system as a decision support tool in Slovak organizations.

abstract={We consider the problem of optimal investment in cybersecurity by an enterprise. Optimality is measured with respect to the overall (1) monetary cost of implementation, (2) negative side-effects of cyber-security controls (indirect costs), and (3) mitigation of the cyber-security risk. We consider "passive" and "reactive" threats, the former representing the case where attack attempts are independent of the defender’s plan, the latter, where attackers can adapt and react to an implemented cyber-security defense. Moreover, we model in three different ways the combined effect of multiple cyber-security controls, depending on their degree of complementarity and correlation. We also consider multi-stage attacks and the potential correlations in the success of different stages. First, we formalize the problem as a non-linear multiobjective integer programming.We then convert them into Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP) that very efficiently solve for the exact Paretooptimal solutions even when the number of available controls is large. In our case study, we consider 27 of the most typical security controls, each with multiple intensity levels of implementation, and 37 common vulnerabilities facing a typical SME. We compare our findings against expert-recommended critical controls. We then investigate the effect of the security models on the resulting optimal plan and contrast the merits of different security metrics. In particular, we show the superior robustness of the security measures based on the "reactive" threat model, and the significance of the hitherto overlooked role of correlations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Rapidly evolving cyber threats to National Security Space (NSS) systems increase the risk that skilled adversaries could disrupt, degrade, or destroy mission critical capabilities via cyber means. There are many challenges to deploying effective Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) for space systems, including advanced persistent threats (APT), unknown vulnerabilities, legacy system weaknesses, limited situational awareness, defense-in-depth limitations, rigid and difficult to retrofit architectures, lack of skilled personnel, and resource constraints. In response to these significant challenges, the Air Force Space &amp; Missiles Systems Center (SMC) is leading multiple activities to support SMC space programs with approaches, processes, technologies, tools, and training to rapidly enhance cyber resilience throughout the space program life cycle. As was presented at AIAA Space 20158, SMC (in cooperation with Air Force Space Command) has developed a methodology to tightly couple cyber threats analysis with space systems developmental planning activities, beginning with early space system concepts. This methodology includes: Assessment of Emerging Threats, Mission Impact Analysis, Cyber Risk Profiling, Identifying Capability Gaps, and S&amp;T (Science &amp; Technology) Concepts for Enhanced Cyber Defense. Building on this cyber risk management approach, SMC has initiated activities supporting SMC deployment of enhanced DCO (Defensive Cyber Operations) throughout the space enterprise. This includes targeted cyber defense research, accelerated instantiation of incremental cyber capabilities, and assessment of resulting impacts on the space enterprise. This paper provides a summary of lessons learned from these ongoing efforts, as well as addressing challenges to evolve the space enterprise with increased cyber resilience. Examples of ongoing cyber defense capabilities development are provided. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Assessing the vulnerability of an enterprise’s infrastructure is an important step in judging the security of its network and the trustworthiness and quality of the information that flows through it. Currently, low-level infrastructure vulnerability is often judged in an ad hoc manner, based on the criteria and experience of the assessors. While methodological approaches to assessing an organisation’s vulnerability exist, they are often targeted at higher-level threats, and can fail to accurately represent risk. Our aim in this paper therefore, is to explore a novel, structured approach to assessing low-level infrastructure vulnerability. We do this by placing the emphasis on a controls-based evaluation over a vulnerability-based evaluation. This work aims to investigate a framework for the pragmatic approach that organisations currently use for assessing low-level vulnerability. Instead of attempting to find vulnerabilities in infrastructure, we instead assume the network is insecure, and measure its vulnerability based on the controls that have (and have not) been put in place. We consider different control schemes for addressing vulnerability, and show how one of them, namely the Council on Cyber Security’s Top 20 Critical Security Controls, can be applied. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

Every day, new vulnerabilities are reported and the number of automated attacks is constantly rising. In this article, a new method for detecting such attacks is proposed, whereas cooperating systems analyze incoming requests, identify potential threats and present them to other peers. Each host can then utilize the knowledge and findings of the other peers to identify harmful requests, making the whole system of cooperating servers “remember” and share information about the existing threats, effectively “immunizing” it against them. The method was tested using data from seven different web servers, consisting of over three million of recorded requests. The paper also includes proposed means for maintaining the confidentiality of the exchanged data and analyzes impact of various parameters, including the number of peers participating in the exchange of data. Samples of identified attacks and most common attack vectors are also presented in the paper. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.},

abstract={Today's globalized supply chains are complex systems of systems characterized by a conglomeration of interconnected networks and dependencies. There is a constant supply and demand for materials and information exchange with many entities such as people, organizations, processes, services, products, and infrastructure at various levels of involvement. Fully comprehending supply chain risk (SCR) is a challenging problem, as attacks can be initiated at any point within the system lifecycle and can have detrimental effects to mission assurance. Counterfeit items, from individual components to entire systems, have been found in commercial and government systems. Cyber-attacks have been enabled by suppliers' lack of security. Furthermore, there have been recent trends to incorporate supply chain security to help defend against potential cyber-attacks, however, we find that traditional supply chain risk reduction and screening methods do not typically identify intrinsic vulnerabilities of realized systems. This paper presents the application of a supply chain decision analytics framework for assisting decision makers in performing risk-based cost-benefit prioritization of security investments to manage SCR. It also presents results from a case study along with discussions on data collection and pragmatic insight to supply chain security approaches. This case study considers application of the framework in analyzing the supply chain of a United States Government critical infrastructure construction project, clarifies gaps between supply chain analysis and technical vulnerability analysis, and illustrates how the framework can be used to identify supply chain threats and to suggest mitigations.},

abstract={Smart-grids security is becoming a challenging research area that has emerged in recent years facing the energy sector. Threats are arising every day that could cause great scale of damages in critical infrastructure. Our paper will assess vulnerabilities pertaining to internal security threats associated with the smart grid. We will perform penetration testing using various attack scenarios in a simulated virtual environment involving DNP3 protocol. Vulnerability analysis and penetration testing involving Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack will be addressed. Ultimately, by utilizing theoretical modeling of smart-grid attacks using game theory, we will be able to optimize our detection and mitigation strategies to reduce cyber threats in DNP3 environment. Intrusion detection system (IDS) will be necessary to identify attackers targeting the smart grid infrastructure. Mitigation techniques will ensure a healthy check of the network.

abstract={The search for a uniform risk analysis approach for critical infrastructures has prompted a reexamination of the Risk Analysis and Management for Critical Asset Protection (RAMCAP) methodology to see if it can accommodate emerging threats from climate change, aging infrastructure and cyber attacks. This chapter examines the challenges involved in taking a site-specific formulation and turning it into a general model capable of analyzing performance under a full range of simulated conditions. The AWWA J100-10 standard provides the blueprint for a basic RAMCAP model that calculates risk as an attenuation of consequences via probability estimates of vulnerability, threat, resilience and countermeasures. The RAMCAP model was subjected to varying scenario loads in deterministic simulations that examined all hypothetical conditions and probabilistic simulations that examined likely conditions. RAMCAP performance was measured by the average net benefit and represented by the distribution of component values. Contrary to expectations, RAMCAP performance did not improve as the number of scenarios increased in the simulations. The methods and results of this study may hold implications for other critical infrastructure risk methodologies that are based on consequence, threat and vulnerability. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.},

abstract={Inherent vulnerabilities in software applications running in a computer network, bringing in personal devices to the network on an ad-hoc basis, a growing trend of network users accessing Web and utilise Cloud services remotely, and increasingly mature and stealthy techniques used by cybercriminals have left the whole network vulnerable to cyberattacks. This requires a network administrator to better understand the dynamic threat landscape and its associated risks so that appropriate security controls and policies could be applied as a countermeasure against existing and new cyber-attacks. However, measuring the risk of cyber attacks and identifying the most recent modus-operandi of cyber criminals on large computer networks can be difficult due to the wide range of services and applications running within the network, the multiple vulnerabilities associated with each application, the severity associated with each vulnerability, and the ever-changing attack vector of cyber criminals. In this paper we propose a framework to represent these features, enabling real-time network enumeration and traffic analysis to be carried out, in order to produce quantified measures of risk at specific points in time. We validate the approach using real-network data from a University network and show how the data can be used to understand the attack patterns and their trends. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Vulnerability analysis methods have gained more interest in recent years, due to the publicity of international cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, emerging hacktivism and business reconnaissance. This shift has sparked discussion on the costs of risk management in software development. In this paper, we discuss vulnerability analysis in the context of critical systems: systems in which an operative outage endangers the continuity of the organization. As a solution to the expenses of improved information security, we define a concept termed business resilience, which offers a general reference point for relevant improvements to a system. In this context, business refers to any profit-centered element of an organization. We present an approach to determining the criticality of an identified threat to the business. We also propose a methodology for utilizing business resilience properties in dynamic environments, such as the high security networks used by the military. The discussion and views presented in this paper can be adopted by any organization concerned about sensitive and classified contents stored and communicated in current ICT systems in the context of cloud computing. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Evaluating the security of an enterprise is an important step towards securing its system and resources. However existing research provide limited insight into understanding the impact attacks have on the overall security goals of an enterprise. We still lack effective techniques to accurately measure the predictive security risk of an enterprise taking into account the dynamic attributes associated with vulnerabilities that can change over time. It is therefore critical to establish an effective cyber-security analytics strategy to minimize risk and protect critical infrastructure from external threats before it even starts. In this paper we present an integrated view of security for computer networks within an enterprise, understanding threats and vulnerabilities, performing analysis to evaluate the current as well as future security situation of an enterprise to address potential situations. We formally define a non-homogeneous Markov model for quantitative security evaluation using Attack Graphs which incorporates time dependent covariates, namely the vulnerability age and the vulnerability discovery rate to help visualize the future security state of the network leading to actionable knowledge and insight. We present experimental results from applying this model on a sample network to demonstrate the practicality of our approach. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a methodology for assessing the vulnerability of power and energy systems and components to weapons effects, accidental explosions, and attacks by terrorists, saboteurs, and vandals. The functioning of these systems depends on such devices and equipment as fuel tanks, pumps, transformers, control panels, insulators, wiring and piping, and generators. Damage mechanisms for components such as these and the means to determine their occurrence for specific components and threats are described herein. The damage mechanisms considered include those associated with airblast, shock, cratering, ballistic impact, penetration, and fire threats, although the methodology could be extended to include a broader spectrum of threats including cyber, electromagnetic, hostile vehicle etc. To facilitate assessment of the sorts of infrastructure elements that are used by power generation and energy transmission utilities, a damage function for individual components is introduced. For example, the damage function can provide a means to estimate the level of damage incurred by various equipment as a function of their distance from the point of detonation, and the size and type of the explosive used. This function may be incorporated as part of an assessment code, or it may also be used as a standalone means to estimate damage for a specific utility component, such as described in [2]. © 2015 IEEE.},

Like the systems themselves, security threats feature both cyber and physical elements. Although to apply divide et impera approaches helps handling system complexity, to consider just one aspect at a time does not provide adequate risk awareness and hence does not allow to design the most appropriate countermeasures. To support this claim, in this paper we provide a joint application of two model-driven techniques for physical and cyber-security evaluation. We apply two UML profiles, namely SecAM (for cyber-security) and CIP-VAM (for physical security), in combination. In such a way, we demonstrate the synergy between both profiles and the need for their tighter integration in the context of a reference case study from the railway domain.

abstract={The cyber security exposure of resilient systems is frequently described as an attack surface. A larger surface area indicates increased exposure to threats and a higher risk of compromise. Ad-hoc addition of dynamic proactive defenses to distributed systems may inadvertently increase the attack surface. This can lead to cyber friendly fire, a condition in which adding superfluous or incorrectly configured cyber defenses unintentionally reduces security and harms mission effectiveness. Examples of cyber friendly fire include defenses which themselves expose vulnerabilities (e.g., through an unsecured admin tool), unknown interaction effects between existing and new defenses causing brittleness or unavailability, and new defenses which may provide security benefits, but cause a significant performance impact leading to mission failure through timeliness violations. This paper describes a prototype service capability for creating semantic models of attack surfaces and using those models to (1) automatically quantify and compare cost and security metrics across multiple surfaces, covering both system and defense aspects, and (2) automatically identify opportunities for minimizing attack surfaces, e.g., by removing interactions that are not required for successful mission execution. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Software vulnerabilities are the weaknesses in the software that inadvertently allow dangerous operations. If the vulnerability is in a network service, it poses serious security threats because a cyber-attacker can exploit it to gain unauthorized access to the system. Hence, rapid discovery and remediation of network vulnerabilities is critical issues in network security. In today's dynamic IT environment, it is common practice that an organization prioritizes the mitigation of discovered vulnerabilities according to their risk levels. Currently available technologies, however, associate each vulnerability to the static risk level which does not take the unique characteristics of the target network into account. This often leads to inaccurate risk prioritization and less-than-optimal resource allocation. In this research, we introduce a novel way of quantifying the risk of network vulnerability by augmenting the static risk level with conditions specific to the target network. The method calculates the risk value of each vulnerability by measuring the proximity to the untrusted network and risk of the neighboring hosts. The resulting risk value, RCR is a composite index of the individual risk, network location and neighborhood risk conditions. Thus, it can be effectively used for prioritization, comparison and trending. We tested the methodology through the network intrusion simulation. The results shows average 88.9% the correlation between RCR and number of successful attacks on each vulnerability. © 2015 IEEE.},

Thus, we are interested in developing an automated methodology for identifying tangible and verifiable evidence of potential threats within hacker forums, IRC channels, and carding shops. To identify threats, we couple machine learning methodology with information retrieval techniques. Our approach allows us to distill potential threats from the entirety of collected hacker contents. We present several examples of identified threats found through our analysis techniques. Results suggest that hacker communities can be analyzed to aid in cyber threat detection, thus providing promising direction for future work. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The number and type of threats to modern information and communication networks has increased massively in the recent years. Furthermore, the system complexity and interconnectedness has reached a level which makes it impossible to adequately protect networked systems with standard security solutions. There are simply too many unknown vulnerabilities, potential configuration mistakes and therefore enlarged attack surfaces and channels. A promising approach to better secure today's networked systems is information sharing about threats, vulnerabilities and indicators of compromise across organizations; and, in case something went wrong, to report incidents to national cyber security centers. These measures enable early warning systems, support risk management processes, and increase the overall situational awareness of organizations. Several cyber security directives around the world, such as the EU Network and Information Security Directive and the equivalent NIST Framework, demand specifically national cyber security centers and policies for organizations to report on incidents. However, effective tools to support the operation of such centers are rare. Typically, existing tools have been developed with the single organization as customer in mind. These tools are often not appropriate either for the large amounts of data or for the application use case at all. In this paper, we therefore introduce a novel incident clustering model and a system architecture along with a prototype implementation to establish situational awareness about the security of participating organizations. This is a vital prerequisite to plan further actions towards securing national infrastructure assets. © 2015 Centre for Multidisciplinary Research, Innovation and Collaboration (C-MRiC.ORG).},

abstract={As our infrastructure, economy, and national defense increasingly rely upon cyberspace and information technology, the security of the systems that support these functions becomes more critical. Recent proclamations from the White House, Department of Defense, and elsewhere have called for increased resilience in our cyber capabilities. The growth of cyber threats extends well beyond the traditional areas of security managed by Information Technology software. The new cyber threats are introduced through vulnerabilities in infrastructures and industries supporting IT capital and operations. These vulnerabilities drive establishment of the area of cyber physical systems security. Cyber physical systems security integrates security into a wide range of interdependent computing systems and adjacent systems architectures. However, the concept of cyber physical system security is poorly understood, and the approach to manage vulnerabilities is fragmented. As cyber physical systems security is better understood, it will require a risk management framework that includes an integrated approach across physical, information, cognitive, and social domains to ensure resilience. The expanse of the threat environment will require a systems engineering approach to ensure wider, collaborative resiliency. Approaching cyber physical system security through the lens of resilience will enable the application of both integrated and targeted security measures and policies that ensure the continued functionality of critical services provided by our cyber infrastructure. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).},

abstract={Power grids are often run near the operational limits because of increasing electricity demand, where even small disturbances could possibly trigger major blackouts. The attacks are the potential threats to trigger large-scale cascading failures in the power grid. In particular, the attacks mean to make substations/transmission lines lose functionality by either physical sabotages or cyber attacks. Previously, the attacks were investigated from substation-only/transmission-line-only perspectives, assuming attacks can occur only on substations/transmission lines. In this paper, we introduce the joint substation-transmission line perspective, which assumes attacks can happen on substations, transmission lines, or both. The introduced perspective is a nature extension to substation-only and transmission-line-only perspectives. Such extension leads to discovering many joint substation-transmission line vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the joint substation-transmission line attack strategies. In particular, we design a new metric, the component interdependency graph (CIG), and propose the CIG-based attack strategy. In simulations, we adopt IEEE 30 bus system, IEEE 118 bus system, and Bay Area power grid as test benchmarks, and use the extended degree-based and load attack strategies as comparison schemes. Simulation results show the CIG-based attack strategy has stronger attack performance. © 2015 IEEE.},

Then, it illustrates the use of a cyber security measure to describe an economic security model for cloud computing system. Moreover, it proposes a cloud provider business model for security issues. Finally, the paper shows a solution related to the vulnerabilities in cloud systems using a new quantitative metric to reduce the probability that an architectural components fails.

abstract={With increasing world-wide connectivity of Information systems, and growth in accessibility of data resources, the threat to the Integrity and Confidentiality of Data and Services has also increased. Every now and then cases of Hacking and Exploitation are being observed. So in order to remain immune and minimize such threats, the Organizations conduct regular Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on their Technical Assets [1]. We at IDRBT have developed a new automated VAPT Testing Tool named Net-Nirikshak 1.0 which will help the Organizations to assess their Application/Services and analyze their Security Posture. Net-Nirikshak 1.0 detects the vulnerabilities based on the applications and Services being used on the target system. Apart from these it detects the SQL Injection vulnerabilities and reports all the Identified vulnerable links on the Target. Further the tool can also exploit the identified SQLI vulnerable links and grab confidential information from Target.The automated VAPT report generated by the tool is sent to the specified Email and all the traces of Scan along with the Report are removed from the Hard disk so as to ensure the Confidentiality of the VAPT Report. All the Technical and Operational aspects of Net-Nirikshak 1.0 are described in this paper along with the Outputs of a sample VAPT Test conducted on www.webscantest.com using Net-Nirikshak 1.0 © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The keen adoption of m-learning by higher education institutions on a global scale because of widespread use of mobile devices requires proper security considerations in order not to expose m-learning systems to cyber-attack. M-learning systems normally comprise three components which are the mobile device, one or multiple servers and network devices. While servers and network infrastructure have some inbuilt security and are usually owned by educational institutions or service providers, who have adequate resources to ensure their security, mobile devices are owned by individuals and generally do not come with protective software such as antivirus. Lack of security tools makes mobile devices vulnerable to many threats and attacks. The objectives of this paper are, therefore, to investigate which components of m-learning environments are prone to attack and what are the common attack routes in Nigerian universities. This paper will recommend solutions to these problems and the findings of this paper can help m-learning system developers to put more security measures on the components of m-learning system that are vulnerable to risks, threats and attacks. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a unified model based assessment framework to quantify threats and vulnerabilities associated with control systems, especially in the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. In the past, this system was primarily utilized as an isolated facility on a local basis, and then it started to be integrated with wide-area networks as the communication technology would make rapid progress. The introduction of smart grid, which is an innovative application of digital processing and communications to the power grid, might lead to more and more cyber threats originated from IT systems. However, an up-to-date power system often requires the realtime operations, which clearly implies that the cyber security would turn out to be a complicated but also crucial issue for the power system. In short, the purpose of this paper is to streamline a comprehensive approach to prioritizing cyber security risks which are expressed by the combination of threats, vulnerabilities, and values in the SCADA components. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

abstract={Utilities in the electric sector currently identify Critical Digital Assets (CDAs) and apply cyber security controls using a deterministic-based process. Because cyber risk is a relatively new area for most utility control operations, the process for identifying cyber vulnerabilities, threat vectors, and their impacts is not clearly defined. As a result, utilities have adopted strategies that use a shotgun approach of all security controls. These strategies can result in either under or overprotection of systems. This paper presents insights of an EPRI funded study regarding the potential utility of applying several hazard and systems analysis methods for determining cyber risk associated with digital systems. Although current hazard analysis methods are not ideally suited to assess phenomena important to cyber security (e.g., potential malware insertion and control tactics), this research yields important insights on how to leverage these methods to enable robust cyber security, vulnerability, and consequence assessment of a critical infrastructure facility. As cyber risk becomes more fully understood, the process by which controls necessary to appropriately protect the system are designed and implemented will be more efficacious. This may allow for an entity to reevaluate their CDAs and provide for a more defensible security plan and better prioritization of risks and resources.},

abstract={Recently, we have experienced cases of how nation-states are confronted with cyber-threats, creating threats to state power through cyber-capabilities and cyber-interaction between actors in the international political system. Such cases are indicated in relations and incidents between the United States and China, Russia and Georgia, Estonia and non-state actors, North Korea and South Korea, as well as between other states and non-state cyber-actors. This research proposes the Social Process for Cyber-Threat Analysis (SPCTA) framework for analyzing cyber-threats to a state. Cyber-threats and risks posed to the state have a foundation in the political, cultural, and economic domains where we may identify causative factors and enabling commonalities present in each state. SPCTA proposes methodology and an algorithm for assessing both qualitative and quantitative factors within these domains that relate to the cyber-disposition of nation-states. As state/nonstate cyber-interaction is a means by which a cyber-actor poses a threat, examination was conducted to identify applicable International Relations theories that would both explain the subject matter and provide a basis for the framework. Neither the Realist nor Liberal schools provide a discrete methodology or framework. The Constructivist school offers an alternative perspective that accommodates a positivist approach to structuring analysis and assessment. It is here that SPCTA presents a cross-disciplinary notion-the convergence of IR theory, social process, and the phenomenon of interaction within the cyber domain. As such, SPCTA provides an applied methodology for identifying and assessing causative factors, capabilities, environment, vulnerabilities, and the utility of cyber-attack upon a state, as well as quantifying these components to derive the level of cyber-threat. SPCTA poses an applied theoretical framework for determining cyber-threats that may exist among states and non-state actors. SPCTA generates information and considerations that may be used to formulate effective policy for mitigating threats from cyber-actors. For the purposes of submission to the 14th European Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security ECCWS 2015 conference, this paper has been reduced to only present the core methodology used in the proposed framework.},

abstract={One of the major challenges to an organization achieving a certain level of preparedness to "effectively" combat existing and future cyber threats and vulnerabilities is its ability to ensure the security and reliability of its networks. Most of the existing efforts are quantitative, by nature, and limited solely to the networks and systems of the organization. It would be unfair to not acknowledge that for sure some progress has been achieved in the way that organizations, as a whole, are now positioning themselves to address the threats (GAO 2012). Unfortunately, so have the skill sets and resource levels improved for attackers-they are increasingly getting better at achieving the unwanted access to organizations' information assets. In large part we believe that some of this is due to the failure by methods to assess the overall vulnerability of the networks. In addition, significant levels of threats and vulnerabilities beyond organizations' networks and systems are not being given the level of attention that is warranted. In this paper, we propose a more comprehensive approach that enables an organization to more realistically assess its "cyber maturity" level in hope of better positioning itself to address existing and new cyber threats. We also propose the need to better understand another missing critical piece to the puzzle-the reliability and security of networks in terms of scientific risk-based metrics (e.g., the severity of individual vulnerabilities and overall vulnerability of the network). Our risk-based metrics are: (1) built on the CVSS Base Score which is modified by developing weights derived from the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to make the overall score more representative of the impact the vulnerability has on the global infrastructure, and (2) rooted in repeatable quantitative characteristics (i.e., vulnerabilities) such as the sum of the probabilities that devices will be compromised via client-side or server-side attacks stemming from software or hardware vulnerabilities. We will demonstrate the feasibility of our method by applying our approach to a case study and highlighting the benefits and impediments which result.},

abstract={SCADA (Supervisory Control &Data Acquisition) System has been the back bone of industrial automation. These systems are built for implementation of control and monitoring for industries. It also covers domains of critical infrastructure such as electricity, gas, water, waste, railway and traffic. In the electrical domain SCADA systems have been widely installed for substation automation. The discovery of worm attacks that targeted the SCADA systems has raised the need for enforcing security measures in these systems. In this paper, the simulation environment to model the threats that attack SCADA distribution systems is proposed. The simulation environment enables the identification of cyber vulnerabilities, the impact of the exploits on controlled physical process and finally provides an assessment based on the criticality. The environment can also be used to develop cyber security mitigations. The drawback of these SCADA systems is that the threat modeling cannot be performed while the system is in execution and it can affect the electrical supply. The simulation environment provides the capabilities of modeling the existing threats and also tests the behavior of the system during potential attacks. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Outer space and cyberspace "together" constitute a unique technologically-created domain that is becoming a prominent locus for international strategic, political and economic power competition. However, while outer space is governed by treaty frameworks established within the UN system and by national laws, no agreed rules exist for cyberspace: it is thus needed to consider an inter-meshed governance regime able to address this specific situation, also beyond conventional legal mechanisms. Any policy development geared towards space security and cybersecurity should take into account the significance of preserving open access to these two global commons whilst takling the respective relevant threats. In the initial reflections about a possible policy development some basic principles appear to be widely accepted as the fact that information sharing on threats and vulnerabilities should ultimately develop into public-private partnerships, or that any policy approach should also strongly consider the human factor as all technical elements and systems are managed by humans. However, many points still remain to be clarified such as the assessment of the nature of an incident or its attribution. In this context, practical rules to cope with imminent challenges in the two domains should be adopted at the earliest possible opportunity. This paper is based on the final results of an ESA preparatory activity encompassing two parallel studies aiming at raising awareness in the space community about the cyber-security issue. These studies address the entire spectrum of space missions falling within the remits of ESA, spanning the whole life-cycle. ESA intends to take into account the outputs and recommendations resulting from the two studies to develop technological solutions and an ESA-internal set of guidelines on cyber-security. The fields of application of these measures shall include non-technical procedures, supply chain control, computer and communications operating procedures. Already existing interinstitutional cooperation between ESA, the European Commission and the European Defence Agency could even be extended to include reflections and/or activities to enhance the cyber-security of the European institutional and commercial space missions. The on-going dialogue among the stakeholders and international partners is instrumental in raising the level of awareness about the increasingly blurred legal distinctions defining the outer space and cyberspace, and paving the way to the development of governance needed to guarantee a sustainable use of outer space in an ever more contested, congested and competitive cyber-security environment.},

We focus on water, recognizing that water is vital for human health and to the function of other critical infrastructures. A cyber attack targets control and monitoring systems of a water utility, known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, and disrupts water operations. Current research is inadequate in developing critical risk assessments using scenario based risk metrics to characterize vulnerabilities in the SCADA networks. Such work forms the basis for a risk-informed management process. This research constructs a scenario-based risk assessment of water treatment and distribution system cybervulnerabilities. We identify vulnerable elements of the network, conduct a failure analysis, and create fault trees for a selected set of cyber intrusion scenarios. Future research will focus on expert elicitation of probabilities of failure of selected events, with the goal of informing decision makers about risk management and mitigation strategies. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={Advanced cyber attacks represent a serious threat to a critical infrastructure. Attack modeling is a way to timely recognize weaknesses and potential threat performances, which in practice want to be avoided. In order to improve attack modeling we defined an attack tree-based model named the Enhanced structured model (ESM). The ESM enables better understanding of attack implementation, which results in improved identification of security weaknesses and analysis of the existing security policy. The ESM is also very suitable as a tool to impart knowledge in the field of advanced cyber security in terms of offensive security. To enable analysts more credible basis for decision support and even more effective transfer of knowledge and new insights into the educational process we present in this paper a quantification of the ESM. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Cyber threats are serious concerns for power systems. For example, hackers may attack power control systems via interconnected enterprise networks. This paper proposes a risk assessment framework to enhance the resilience of power systems against cyber attacks. The duality element relative fuzzy evaluation method is employed to evaluate identified security vulnerabilities within cyber systems of power systems quantitatively. The attack graph is used to identify possible intrusion scenarios that exploit multiple vulnerabilities. An intrusion response system (IRS) is developed to monitor the impact of intrusion scenarios on power system dynamics in real time. IRS calculates the conditional Lyapunov exponents (CLEs) on line based on the phasor measurement unit data. Power system stability is predicted through the values of CLEs. Control actions based on CLEs will be suggested if power system instability is likely to happen. A generic wind farm control system is used for case study. The effectiveness of IRS is illustrated with the IEEE 39 bus system model. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={In recent years e-supply chains have received much research attention. Most of it has been towards improving supply chain management. Supply chain management involves looking at ways to improve the performance of trading partners within the supply chain. It is needless to say that little attention has been placed on improving the information security infrastructure across e-supply chains. The use of Information and Communications Technology, together with the Internet definitely have an impacton the supply chain in a positive way; providing benefits such as cost reduction and better service delivery to customers. However, this also leaves supply chains vulnerable to a number of security threats such as cyber terror, information theft and eavesdropping, amongst other threats. The problem this paper addresses is the lack of a well-formulated approach in e-supply chains to prepare trading partners for security incidents that might occur in the supply chain. Digital forensic readiness offers a data collection framework that has vast capabilities to obtain potentially useful information that can be used for many purposesincluding Digital forensic investigations (DFIs). In this scenario the data collected can be used to detect vulnerabilities across the e-supply chain. It is therefore crucial to contribute different approaches to combat these threats and introduce processes that can prepare trading partners for security incidents. The authors propose an integration of some key security processes in the e-supply chain, which include monitoring the e-supply chain for incidents and collecting forensically sound data, which can be used to assess risk across the e-supply chain or in a court of law. The method proposed is a well-coordinated implementation of digital forensic readiness across the e-supply chain that involves adopting security policies and controls that help provide trading partners with useful information about the activities taking place in the e-supply chain.},

While this change has increased the ease of management and integration, it has also exposed SCADA systems to a myriad of cyber vulnerabilities.

abstract={There is no doubt that cyber attacks pose a potential threat to process control systems and their associated safety systems. The process control system's cyber domain, however, has significant differences, such as priorities, computer hardware, different network architectures and mixture of different communication protocols, from the traditional IT environment. A significant difference is that a successful cyber attack on a control system that results in a loss of control can have serious life and limb consequences, as well significant financial loss should a safety incident result. The solution is to recognize that there is a potential threat and to perform a cyber risk assessment to identify existing vulnerabilities, risks and security gaps, and to develop and implement a plan to address the cyber risks and lower them to an acceptable risk tolerance in a timely manner. The priority should be to protect the 'family jewels' and high-risk processes. Cybersecurity standards are available from ISA/IEC, as is guidance from the U.S. government.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel simulation for estimating the impact of cyber attacks. Current approaches have adopted the probabilistic risk analysis in order to estimate the impact of attacks mostly on assets or business processes. More recent approaches involve vulnerability analysis on networks of systems and sensor input from third-party detection tools in order to identify attack paths. All these methods are focusing on one level at a time, defining impact in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, failing to place people and technology together in an organization’s functional context. We propose an interdependency impact assessment approach, focusing on the responsibilities and the dependencies that flow through the supply chain, mapping them down into an agent-based socio-technical model. This method is useful for modeling consequences across all levels of organizations networks—business processes, business roles, and systems. We are aiming to make chaining analysis on threat scenarios and perform impact assessment, providing situational awareness for cyber defense purposes. Although the model has various applications, our case study is specifically focusing on critical information infrastructures due to the criticality of the systems and the fact that the area is still lacking security-focused research and heavily relies on reliability theory and failure rate. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The shift to a full information-centric paradigm in the battlefield has allowed ConOps to be developed that are only possible using modern network communications systems. Securing these Tactical Networks without impacting their capabilities has been a challenge. Tactical networks with fixed infrastructure have similar vulnerabilities to their commercial counterparts (although they need to be secure against adversaries with greater capabilities, resources and motivation). However, networks with mobile infrastructure components and Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANets) have additional unique vulnerabilities that must be considered. It is useful to examine Tactical Network based ConOps and use them to construct a threat model and baseline cyber security requirements for Tactical Networks with fixed infrastructure, mobile infrastructure and/or ad hoc modes of operation. This paper will present an introduction to threat model assessment. A definition and detailed discussion of a Tactical Network threat model is also presented. Finally, the model is used to derive baseline requirements that can be used to design or evaluate a cyber security solution that can be scaled and adapted to the needs of specific deployments. © 2014 SPIE.},

abstract={Recent advancements in wireless communication are creating a spectrum shortage problem on a daily basis. Recently, Cognitive Radio (CR) has attempted to minimize this problem by allowing secondary users to coexist with primary users without causing interference to their communication through dynamic utilization of free spectrum. CR offers many promising benefits including dynamic spectrum sharing, robust cross-layer adaptation, and collaborative networking. It is anticipated that CR technology will be the next wave of innovation in information and communications technologies. Although operational aspects of CR are being explored vigorously, its security aspects have gained little attention. Due to the dynamic nature of CR networks and the fact that they exposed relatively more to wireless networks, entirely new classes of security threats and challenges are introduced, such as licensed user emulation, selfish misbehaviors and unauthorized use of spectrum bands. To achieve successful deployment of CR technologies in practice, there is a critical need to advance the theoretical understanding of these entirely new classes of security threats and challenges. Therefore, in this paper, our primary objective is to identify and investigate the major known security threats within a CR network (CRN). Our secondary objective is to highlight on how potential threats exploit the vulnerabilities present at different layers of a communication stack.},

Thus, in this paper, an assessment plan for evaluating cyber security of local storage systems in organizations is proposed. The assessment model is based on the idea of cyber security domains and risk matrix. The proposed assessment model has been implemented on two prestigious and important organizations in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Storage systems of the assessed organizations found to have cyber security risks of different scales. This conclusion gives certainty to the fact that organizations are not capable of following the cyber security evolution and secure their storage systems from cyber security vulnerabilities and breaches. Organizations with local storage systems can improve the cyber security of their storage systems by applying certain techniques. Copyright © 2014, IGI Global.},

abstract={Modern power systems heavily rely on the associated cyber network, and cyber attacks against the control network may cause undesired consequences such as load shedding, equipment damage, and so forth. The behaviors of the attackers can be random, thus it is crucial to develop novel methods to evaluate the adequacy of the power system under probabilistic cyber attacks. In this study, the external and internal cyber structures of the substation are introduced, and possible attack paths against the breakers are analyzed. The attack resources and vulnerability factors of the cyber network are discussed considering their impacts on the success probability of a cyber attack. A procedure integrating the reliability of physical components and the impact of cyber attacks against breakers are proposed considering the behaviors of the physical devices and attackers. Simulations are conducted based on the IEEE RTS79 system. The impact of the attack resources and attack attempt numbers are analyzed for attackers from different threats groups. It is concluded that implementing effective cyber security measures is crucial to the cyber-physical power grids. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Society is increasingly dependent on the safe and secure operation of a wide range of complex physical-cyber systems. The consequences of failure of these systems can be very serious, particularly where they form part of a nation's critical national infrastructure. There has been a trend to make greater use of commercial-off-the-shelf technology in the design of these systems, which exposes them to software and hardware vulnerabilities found in many consumer and enterprise systems. There is international recognition that a set of twenty critical security controls can provide significant protection for enterprise IT systems. Asset management is required for effective implementation of seven of these controls. This paper examines how an asset management can contribute to physical-cyber security. The use of asset management systems to support cyber security is novel. It requires additional information to be held regarding the nature, configuration and vulnerabilities of the hardware and software assets and thus supports situational awareness and threat assessment for new vulnerabilities.},

abstract={Information security has increasingly become a core requirement of strategic transport infrastructure due to growing technology and IT driven solutions. Security vulnerabilities were previously considered to be physical issues, and the response from companies was relational, but with the move to information technology based systems and growing global access to the internet and techno savvy citizens, the growing cyber threat is now a reality and the response by companies must match this. An Information Security Management System is vital to the continued development and approach to successful holistic information security policies and controls. The main recognised standard for this approach is ISO 27001:2005 (International Standards Organisation), which has recently been updated to a 2013 version. This describes a number of the requirements that an organisation should adhere to, such as business continuity planning, testing, management input and appropriate resource allocation, but also discusses the tenants of the approach for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, in making decisions and embedding them in the risk assessment process. The UK Government has taken this a further step and, based on ISO 27001, have produced an additional set of requirements specifically aimed at government service providers to assure the telecom services; this is known as CAS(T).},

abstract={Most existing approaches to developing cloud applications using threat analysis involve program vulnerability analyses for identifying the security holes associated with malware attacks. New malware attacks can bypass firewall-based detection by bypassing stack protection and by using Hypertext Transfer Protocol logging, kernel hacks, and library hack techniques, and to the cloud applications. In performing threat analysis for unspecified malware attacks, software engineers can use a taint analysis technique for tracking information flows between attack sources (malware) and detect vulnerabilities of targeted network applications. This paper proposes a threat risk analysis model incorporating an improved attack tree analysis scheme for solving the mobile security problem, in the model, Android programs perform taint checking to analyse the risks posed by suspicious applications. In probabilistic risk analysis, defence evaluation metrics are used for each attack path for assisting a defender simulate the attack results against malware attacks and estimate the impact losses. Finally, a case of threat analysis of a typical cyber security attack is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The global space market has been continuously growing in the last years; even during this deep economic crisis. It is just another symptom of the growing importance and maturity of the space sector. Indeed, many other sectors depend to some extent on satellite services, including finance, communication, transport, communication or military. This growing relevance of space-based services in our societies, although mostly unnoticed by citizens, has gathered attention from several types of attackers: from hacktivists such as Anonymous, to cyber-crooks or hostile governments. These groups of attackers are not equally attracted towards all space missions. As an example; earth observation or military missions will gain more attention from hostile governments, communication missions will typically be more attractive for cyber-crooks as long as they can obtain benefit from them; and virtually anything with a minimum notoriety will be a target for hacktivists. Also, typically, the skills and resources of the different types of attackers will differ significantly, with cyber-armies clearly on top. Few people deny today that cybersecurity has to be carefully considered in current and future space missions. Yet, not all missions are exposed to the same threats or present the same vulnerabilities; quoting Sun Tzu in the book 'Art of War': "If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles. if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle." Consequently, a deep knowledge of the attacker groups' interests and skills together with a deep understanding of the mission business, its value-not only for the organization but also for third parties-, its feared events, and its vulnerabilities is crucial to define safeguards that effectively address the cyber-security risks faced by the mission. Performing this kind of analysis is complex and requires special knowledge and skills. Doing it for each space mission is, therefore, costly and not always possible if the appropriate resources are not available. Still, it is possible to significantly ease the implementation of this analysis by providing adequate tools to mission planners. This paper presents the results of a study on the cyber-security risks of space missions and associated mitigation measures launched by ESA that will be finished in July 2014. Among the study objectives are developing adequate tools for mission planners so that they can easily identify cyber-security safeguards that shall be applied in the mission.},

abstract={Information security practitioners face a challenging task of assessing the information security risks. The lack of complete information about the vulnerabilities in the system leads to the problem of information asymmetry between the security stakeholders. This leads to difficulty in assessing the severity of vulnerabilities and estimation of the impact of an attack. There are at least two approaches to deal with information asymmetry in the information security market, namely market methods and financial instruments. This paper focuses on a relatively novel method: prediction markets, to deal with the information asymmetry problem in information security domain. In this paper, we examine the applicability of prediction markets in forecasting and assessment of information security events. We describe the usefulness of prediction markets in prediction of vulnerabilities, setting values for vulnerabilities and threats, and as a source of aggregating security information for pricing of cyber-financial instruments, such as cyber-insurance. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Risk protection has long been one of the main tasks of companies in a wide scope of business. From extensive range of risks the cyber-risks highlight as one of the most important. Cyber-risks are generated from hackers, malicious software, disgruntled employees, competitors, and many other sources both internal and external. Internal and external attacks on corporate assets and rapidly growing technology forced corporate management to conduct more appropriate awareness of the information security risks to information assets. The information security risk assessment, when performed correctly, can give corporate managers the information they need in order to understand and control the risks to their assets. The risks are in much more detail analysed in economic sectors, but in recent years there is increasing of risk assessment practice in the world of information technology. The model presented in this paper integrates the management and analysis of information risks and decision-making theory and thus creates a framework for the integrated management information system based on the technological risk assessment and Bayesian learning. The paper shows simulation and two case study scenarios in which is presented a potentially wide range of usage.},

abstract={Since 2008, Cyberspace is officially regarded as a distinct military domain, along with land, sea and air for many countries (Goel, 2011). Several nations are developing defensive and offensive cyber capabilities for this domain. The nature of warfare in cyberspace is radically different than the traditional warfare: the attacks are more remote, stealthy and it may be impossible to detect the identity of the adversary (Greengard, 2010). Moreover, the time parameter becomes extremely important in this domain since conducting an attack takes only seconds even if the target is at the globally farthest point possible. Therefore, the power and impacts of cyber operations are limited by fast computation and transmission skills of your front. Nations need intelligence in this relatively new domain of war in order to know the strengths and weaknesses of other nations and themselves. With cyber intelligence of high quality, nations can assess the effects of attacks; detect their vulnerabilities, therefore mitigating the risks and implement cyber security processes based on well-defined decisions (Rudner, 2013). This paper presents a literature survey on computer science methodologies that can be useful for intelligence officers working in the cyberspace. The methodologies including defensive identification methods such as incident response strategies, social network analysis (Yip et al., 2012) (Benjamin and Hsinchun, 2012), intrusion detection systems (Zaman and Karray, 2009) and anomaly detections (Chandola et al., 2009) as well as offensive methods such as disinformation, destruction of information and communication, and advance persistent threats (APTs).},

abstract={The maritime sector is critical in terms of economic activities and commercial impact not only for the European society but more importantly for the Mediterranean EU Member States, especially under the current economic turmoil. Commercial ports are the main gateways and face increased requirements, responsibilities and needs in view of a secure and sustainable maritime digital environment. Therefore, they have to rely on complicated and advanced facilities, ICT infrastructure and trustworthy e-maritime services in order to optimize their operations. This paper aims at alleviating this gap on the basis of a holistic approach that addresses the security of the dual nature of ports' Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs). In particular, it introduces a collaborative security management system (CYSM system), which enables ports' operators to: (a) model physical and cyber assets and interdependencies; (b) analyse and manage internal / external / interdependent physical and cyber threats / vulnerabilities; and (c) evaluate / manage physical and cyber risks against the requirements specified in the ISPS Code and ISO27001. © 2014 IEEE.},

The attacks affect the network control plane and /or the data plane. Critical infrastructures, requiring uninterrupted operation, maintenance, and protection, have need of robust and secured control SCADA systems.

abstract={With the development of communication industry, the smartphone plays a more important role in people's lives, providing a rich functionality with a variety of operating system platforms (such as: Symbian, Windows Mobile, Android, etc.). However, since the internet becomes increasingly complex and changeable brought by the cyber threats and vulnerabilities, more and more manufacturers focus on the security evaluation of smartphone operating system to make their product more secure. At present, the international security assessment criteria of information product is the common criteria (CC), which is the foundation of the protection profile (PP) and can provide function requirements and assurance requirements as the basis for security evaluation. In view of this fact, this paper researches the security mechanisms and analyses the risk factors in different smartphone operating systems. Then, this paper determines the security objectives and security requirements used for the common smartphone operating system. Finally, this paper proposes the corresponding protection profile in EAL4+ (evaluation assurance level 4 including the extended security assurance requirements) for the smartphone operating system based on the CC.

abstract={Protecting information assets is very vital to the core survival of an organization. By increasing in cyber-attacks and viruses worldwide, it has become essential for organizations to adopt innovative and rigorous procedures to keep these vital assets out of the reach of exploiters. Although worldwide complying with an international information security standard such as ISO 27001 has been raised, with over 7000 registered certificates, few Iranian companies are under ISO 27001 certified. Also organization needs to perform a risk assessment in order to determine the organization's asset exposure to risk and determine the best way to manage this. The determination of risk within the methodology is based upon the standard formula, which the risk is calculated from the multiplication of the asset value, threats and vulnerability. The ISO 27001 requires is that 'An appropriate risk assessment shall be undertaken'. One of the main factors for risk assessment is identifying and scoring of Information asset in this process. Due to different values of asset in organizations, the main purpose of this study is to identify and investigate a weighted method to assign different values of assets in order to minimize vulnerability in manufacturing systems. This study also aims at improving asset value scoring by using heuristic methods. A real world case study was selected for implementation of this approach based on ISO27001 in Iran. © 2014 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.},

We propose an interdependency impact assessment approach, focusing on the responsibilities and the dependencies that flow through the supply chain, mapping them down into an agent - based socio - technical model. This method should be especially useful for modeling consequences across all levels of complex organizations networks - business processes, business roles and systems. We are aiming to make forward and backward inferences on threat scenarios and perform impact assessment, providing situational awareness and vulnerability analysis for cyber defense purposes. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Department of the Defense has transitioned smart devices into the battlefield as a portable hand-held unmanned aerial vehicle ground control station without adequate cyber security protections, putting critical mission data at risk to cyber security attacks. Industry has developed software apps for smart phones and tablets that allows soldiers to not only pilot unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but to share and receive intelligence and reconnaissance videos and images remotely from the ground control station (GCS) or directly from the UAV. The Department of Defense has not developed a secure communication network that will support a large quantity of smart devices, nor certification, standards or policies for operation of secure smart devices. Therefore, mission critical information will be shared through unsecured, mobile and wireless networks and through unclassified, unsecure smart technology that are vulnerable to cyber security risks. Lack of security of the mobile and wireless networks and smart devices could result in the unintentional sharing of data as well as loss of control of the UAV to enemies. The Department of Defense has failed to develop a threat model and risk assessment to identify the cyber security threats and ensure the proper security countermeasures are in place. This paper will analyze the cyber security vulnerabilities within the communication links, smart devices hardware, specifically smart phones and tablets, and software applications to develop a risk model of the threat profile of the GCS networking hub. This model will help designers and users of the military and civilian UAV communities to understand the threat profile of the GCS networking hub to develop a secure communication network based upon the vulnerabilities identified for smart phones and tablets. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Throughout history, there have been many events and dangers that threaten state security, causing heavy loss of life, disease, injuries, destruction of property, displacement of large numbers of people and heavy economic losses. Political unrest on international and local levels and recent technological developments increase the seriousness of threats against national security. The concept of security has evolved gradually, especially since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and end of the Cold War. The lingering impact of the policy of the bipolar world has blurred the image of relations between states. However, it provides an opportunity to understand and identify new threats and emerging conflicts, in addition to many unsolved problems. Simultaneously, globalisation has changed international rules and norms, in order to facilitate the rapid flow of capital and technology, with a weakening of national barriers. Non-governmental actors now play key roles in international politics, some as a threat, and others bridging the gap between communities and nations. In these circumstances, the role of the state began to suffer and the accepted traditional concept of power was challenged. Today, a major issue of such concern worldwide, arousing heated debate at both national and international levels, is terrorism. The threat of terrorism has never been as prominent as it seems to be at the present time. Terrorism is an old phenomenon that has existed since the emergence of human societies, but the threat of terrorism has increased steadily over the past 30 years. With technological and technical progress, the actions of terrorists have become more dangerous and destructive, while the perpetrators of such acts are becoming more elusive. There are few parts of the world that have escaped terrorism since late 1960s (Mythen and Walklate 2006). The phenomenon of terrorism is changing, while the motives of terrorism remain the same. The world today faces new and unfamiliar kinds of weapons. The international system, intelligence systems, security procedures and tactics which are expected to protect people, nations and governments, are not able to meet this new and devastating enemy. The methods and strategies developed to combat terrorism over the years are providing ineffective, as the enemy no longer attacks only with hijacked plans, truck bombs or suicide bombers. Terrorists may engage in cyber-terrorism, the use of cyberspace to launch attacks. The integration of the virtual and physical worlds, is a weakness confronting security agents (Collin 1996). This paper outlines a PhD proposal, which seeks to design an effective framework for the potential threat of cyber-terrorism on national security, compared with conventional terrorism by addressing three main themes: awareness-vulnerabilities-response, important in assessment of any security threat. According to Denning (2000) to understand the potential threat of cyber-terrorism, we should consider two factors: first, whether there are targets that are vulnerable to attack, and, secondly, whether actors have the ability and motivation to attack them. In this proposal a preliminary review of relevant literature will be introduced, followed by the research questions to be addressed and the proposed methods to address them. Then the expected time frame will be considered.},

abstract={Recent malware, like Stuxnet and Flame, constitute a major threat to networked critical infrastructures (NCIs), e.g., power plants. They revealed several vulnerabilities in today's NCIs, but most importantly they highlighted the lack of an efficient scientific approach to conduct experiments that measure the impact of cyber threats on both the physical and the cyber parts of NCIs. In this paper, we present EPIC, a novel cyber-physical testbed, and a modern scientific instrument that can provide accurate assessments of the effects that cyber-attacks may have on the cyber and physical dimensions of NCIs. To meet the complexity of today's NCIs, EPIC employs an Emulab-based testbed to recreate the cyber part of NCIs and multiple software simulators for the physical part. Its main advantage is that it can support very accurate, real-time, repeatable, and realistic experiments with heterogeneous infrastructures.We show through several case studies how EPIC can be applied to explore the impact that cyber-attacks and Information and Communications Technology system disruptions have on critical infrastructures. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Most of current industries and their critical infrastructure rely heavily on the Internet for everything. The increase in the online services and operations for various industries has led to an increase in different security threats and malicious activities. In US, the department of homeland security reported recently that there have been 200 attacks on core critical infrastructures in the transportation, energy, and communication industries (Erwin et al., 2012). This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on the Internet, which has become an ideal channel and vital source of malicious activities and various security threats. These threats could have an impact on different distributed systems within and across all the critical infrastructures, such as industrial networks, financial online systems and services, nuclear power generation and control systems, airlines and railway traffic controllers, satellite communication networks, national healthcare information systems ⋯ etc. The major problem is that the existing Internet mechanisms and protocols are not appropriately designed to deal with such recently developed problems. Therefore, a rigorous research is required to develop security approaches and technologies that are capable of responding to this new evolving context. This paper presents various security threats and incidents over the past recent years on different critical infrastructure domains. It introduces some security measures including vulnerability assessment and penetration testing approaches for critical infrastructure.},

abstract={Cellular networks play an increasing role supporting critical government, including military and private information systems. Enhanced capability and ubiquity of mobile devices (i.e., smartphones) is resulting in increasing cyber exploit developments targeting the smartphone and growing concern of exploits targeting the cellular infrastructure. Telecommunication advances such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) continue to move cellular communications to an all IP core. An all IP core is part of the move to Next Generation Network (NGN). However, the transition to NGN is expected to occur over time, and during the lengthy transition period multiple generations of telecommunication must coexist and interoperate. Legacy telecommunication equipment such as 3G cellular communications and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) must interoperate with modern telecommunication equipment such as 4G/LTE and IMS. Cellular telecommunications provide IP connectivity to external networks including the Internet. Thus, both legacy and NGN cellular telecommunications are vulnerable to the same classes of threats as other networked computer systems connected to the Internet, in addition to threats associated with their legacy systems. Cyber security analysis of these systems remains a significant challenge. Traditional techniques such as red-teaming, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing are often unsatisfactory and limited in scope because of the lack of access to telecommunication infrastructure equipment. The consequence is that the effects of a cyber-attack on cellular telecommunications are often unknown.In order to provide greater cellular telecommunications security posture and insight to system providers, equipment manufacturers, and researchers, security analysis of these systems must occur. Performing experiments on telecommunication systems or on a telecommunication testbed is a key part of security analysis. To overcome the problems with security analysis using expensive telecommunication hardware, Sandia National Laboratories has developed a cellular telecommunication cyber-security analysis testbed using physical hardware, extensive virtualization and emulated machines, and simulation to answer complex system questions about cellular systems and their interaction with legacy and NGN fixed systems. In this paper we will discuss the testbed development and components, several use-cases that were executed during the course of the study which leverage the testbed, the types of cyber-attacks that can be assessed, and the class of questions security analysts can now ask and answer about cyber-attacks against cellular systems. In the use-cases we used the testbed to assess the system-level impacts when published component-level vulnerabilities are exploited by a red team. © 2013 IEEE.},

The Duality Element Relative Fuzzy Evaluation Method (DERFEM) is used to evaluate quantitatively security vulnerabilities within cyber systems of power systems; the Attack Graph is employed to identify intrusion scenarios that exploit multiple vulnerabilities; an System Stability Monitoring and Response System (SSMARS) is developed to monitor the impact of intrusion scenarios on power system dynamics in real time. SSMARS is a novel PMU application for the Smart Grid. It is designed be implemented in a RTO/ISO control center to assess and enhance power system security on line. SSMARS calculates the Conditional Lyapunov Exponents (CLEs) in real time based on the Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data. Power system stability is predicted through the values of CLEs. Control actions based on CLEs are suggested if power system instability is likely to happen. The effectiveness of SSMARS is illustrated with the IEEE 39 bus system model. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS) monitor and control industrial processes, and enable automation in industry facilities. Many of these facilities are regarded as Critical Infrastructures (CIs). Due to the increasing use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) IT products and connectivity offerings, CIs have become an attractive target for cyber-attacks. A successful attack could have significant consequences. An important step in securing Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) against cyber-attacks is risk analysis - understanding security risks, based on a systematic analysis of information on vulnerabilities, cyber threats, and the impacts related to the targeted system. Existing risk analysis approaches have various limitations, such as scalability and practicability problems. In contrast to previous work, we propose a practical and vulnerability-centric risk analysis approach for determining security risks associated with advanced, multi-step cyber-attacks. In order to examine multi-step attacks that exploit chains of vulnerabilities, we map vulnerabilities into preconditions and effects, and use rule-based reasoning for identifying advanced attacks and their path through a CII. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Due to the scalability of resources and performance, as well as improved maintainability it is apparent that cloud computing will eventually reach IT services that are operating critical infrastructures. Since IT infrastructures have become an integral part of almost all organisations, cloud computing will have a significant impact on them. Protecting sensitive critical infrastructure data in the cloud environment is the explicit focus of our work. The scale and dynamic nature of cloud computing cause challenges for their management, including investigating malicious activity and/or policy failure. Sufficient security metrics needs to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data on the cloud. Hosting critical infrastructure services in the cloud brings with it security and resilience requirements that existing cloud services are not well placed to address. The protection of critical infrastructure and data has been particularly highlighted with the increase of advanced persistent threats being designed to specifically target the systems that control these infrastructures. There had been a belief in the industry that even if these control systems had vulnerabilities, they were not actively being targeted, but this is now believed to be unrealistic. The severity of the control system specific malware and cyber attacks has led to an increased awareness and understanding from security vendors, as well as the government, both in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Gaining a deeper understanding of the infrastructure security needs is of utmost importance as there is currently a paradigm shift in assessing the extent of risks and protecting against zero-day vulnerabilities. To continue to offer safe and reliable services for public consumption, infrastructure providers need to recognise they have a problem and lack adequate tools, processes and experience to deal with it. It is inevitable that cloud computing will be introduced into their computing paradigm, and effective protection metrics need to be developed to deal with this revolution. Multiple intrusion detection activities have been introduced to address the issue of intrusion detection within cloud computing environments. Security, risk management, control, and trust are important issues that deter and holdback organisations from fully adopting cloud computing and profiting from its many advantages. Our research aims to develop a framework for the protection of critical infrastructure data in the cloud computing environment. We aim to develop a model that can be tailored to the different cloud environments, creating anomaly based intrusion detection techniques tailored to the specialist nature of the cloud computing environment. Our framework should provide monitoring of the network and have an improved detection efficiency based on the efforts in literature. It will be composed of network-based IDS, with a distributed architecture so that there is no single point of failure. The use of unsupervised learning methods will observe the behaviours of users within the network.},

abstract={As federal agencies and businesses rely more on cyber infrastructure, they are increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks that can cause damages disproportionate to the sophistication and cost to launch the attack. In response, regulatory authorities call for focusing attention on enhancing infrastructure resilience. For example, in the USA, President Obama issued an Executive Order and policy directives focusing on improving the resilience and security of cyber infrastructure to a wide range of cyber threats. Despite the national and international importance, resilience metrics to inform management decisions are still in the early stages of development. We apply the resilience matrix framework developed by Linkov et al. (Environ Sci Technol 47:10108-10110, 2013) to develop and organize effective resilience metrics for cyber systems. These metrics link national policy goals to specific system measures, such that resource allocation decisions can be translated into actionable interventions and investments. In this paper, a number of metrics have been identified and assessed using quantitative and qualitative measures found in the literature. We have proposed a generic approach and could integrate actual data, technical judgment, and literature-based measures to assess system resilience across physical, information, cognitive, and social domains. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).},

abstract={Technological advances have changed the manner in which ordinary citizens conduct their daily activities. Many of these activities are carried out over the Internet. These include filling tax returns, online banking, job searching and general socializing. Increased bandwidth and proliferation of mobile phones with access to Internet in Albania imply increased access to Internet by the Albanian population. Such massive increased in access to Internet increases vulnerabilities to cyber crime and attacks and threatens the national security. As a result, Albania remains one of the countries that are targeted by phishing attacks. As a response, various entities engage in cyber security awareness initiatives and trainings with the aim to create cyber security awareness (CSA) among the citizens and the state institutions that operate in Albania. In the absence of a worthy national cyber security policy, however, these awareness initiatives and programmes are delivered through a variety of independent mechanisms. Various entities engage in cyber security awareness training each with its specific objectives and focus areas. It is argued in this paper that cyber security is complex and multi-faceted. No single solution can effectively address it and none of the participant actors can fight it by it's own. While the current means to create cyber security awareness does make impact, the fragmented and uncoordinated nature thereof have a potential to create its own dynamics. The focus of organizations and different institutional actors is, to deliver on their own objectives translates to some extent into the optimization of the behavior of individual entities as opposed to the optimization of the national cyber security awareness as a whole. This paper evaluates the extent to which the current cyber security awareness initiatives address the cyber security threats and risks. The assessment is based on the initiatives objectives, alignment of the program to the cyber threats, and the target audience.},

abstract={Mission assurance policy and risk management are essential in enabling decision makers to ensure successful completion of missions by addressing the security status of cyber assets. This paper presents a novel mission assurance policy that adapts to the dynamic security status of all mission assets to quickly and automatically determine mission assurance level and to decide what changes are needed accordingly. The novelty of this mission assurance policy stems from using a time Petri net model for determining the security status of cyber assets, and then employing binary or multi-valued logic decision diagrams to assess the mission assurance level. The ability of a mission assurance policy to successfully complete its objectives depends mainly on whether a risk management scheme is provided to reduce risk to an acceptable level. To that end, this paper also describes a risk management scheme to systematically deal with the main factors of risk management such as the temporal interdependencies of cyber assets, impact of attacks, and risk mitigation. Given that the status of cyber assets changes due to the dynamic cybersecurity environment of asset vulnerabilities, threats, and recovery, the proposed mission assurance policy and risk management scheme enable decision makers to cope with the real-time assessment of mission assurance level. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).},

abstract={Securing high value and critical assets is one of the biggest challenges facing this nation and others around the world. In modern integrated systems, there are four potential modes of attack available to an adversary: • physical only attack, • cyber only attack, • physical-enabled cyber attack, • cyber-enabled physical attack. Blended attacks involve an adversary working in one domain to reduce system effectiveness in another domain. This enables the attacker to penetrate further into the overall layered defenses. Existing vulnerability assessment (VA) processes and software tools which predict facility vulnerabilities typically evaluate the physical and cyber domains separately. Vulnerabilities which result from the integration of cyber-physical control systems are not well characterized and are often overlooked by existing assessment approaches. In this paper, we modified modification of the timely detection methodology, used for decades in physical security VAs, to include cyber components. The Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool (PACRAT) prototype illustrates an integrated vulnerability assessment that includes cyber-physical interdependencies. Information about facility layout, network topology, and emplaced safeguards is used to evaluate how well suited a facility is to detect, delay, and respond to attacks, to identify the pathways most vulnerable to attack, and to evaluate how often safeguards are compromised for a given threat or adversary type. We have tested the PACRAT prototype on critical infrastructure facilities and the results are promising. Future work includes extending the model to prescribe the recommended security improvements via an automated cost-benefit analysis. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a system of system which integrates physical system with cyber capability in order to improve the physical performance. It is being widely used in areas closely related to national economy and people's livelihood, therefore CPS security problems have drawn a global attention and an appropriate risk assessment for CPS is in urgent need. Existing risk assessment for CPS always focuses on the reliability assessment, using Probability Risk Assessment (PRA). In this way, the assessment of physical part and cyber part is isolated as PRA is difficult to quantify the risks from the cyber world. Methodologies should be developed to assess the both parts as a whole system, considering this integrated system has a high coupling between the physical layer and cyber layer. In this paper, a risk assessment idea for CPS with the use of attack tree is proposed. Firstly, it presents a detailed description about the threat and vulnerability attributes of each leaf in an attack tree and tells how to assign value to its threat and vulnerability vector. Then this paper focuses on calculating the threat and vulnerability vector of an attack path with the use of the leaf vector values. Finally, damage is taken into account and an idea to calculate the risk value of the whole attack path is given. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In Today's age of growing connectivity, anything and everything remains connected. This makes Security, one of the prime concerns of every Information System in Cyber Space. Hence, Information Security Management is something that Organizations cannot afford to compromise. In this evolving era of Offensive technologies, the practice of Cyber Defence has become much more complicated and the need for Security Auditing techniques has gradually increased. In order to preserve their corporate image and protect their valuable information, the Organizations must conduct periodic Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT). VAPT being a proactive Security Auditing technique can efficiently help an Organization to defend its Information systems from various Cyber threats. This paper describes how VAPT tools can be used to identify the Vulnerabilities in the current Security Arrangements and avoid possible Cyber-attacks.

abstract={The financial success of the chemical and petrochemical industry will increasingly depend upon the security of process control systems. This paper presents recommendations and insights gleaned from over 100 security risk assessment (SRA) and process control analyses, using requirements baselines extracted from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publication 800-53 (and Appendix A), the Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, in conjunction with NIST special publication 800-82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems(ICS) Security, to provide the bridge in application of 800-53 controls to IC/SCADA. The paper identifies how current and projected malevolent threats posed by insiders, outsiders, collusion, and system-induced threats can erode system performance in terms of shut downs, sabotage, production disruption, and contamination. The issue is not whether there are clear and present cyber threats, nor whether there are business prudent practices that can be implemented to counter those threats; but rather that there is such a diverse compendium, at times conflicting and often technically obtuse guidance, that clarity is needed to narrow the focus of this guidance to assist those responsible for implementing effective process control security. The paper focuses on application of business-prudent controls and discusses how disparities in implementation of controls can exacerbate system vulnerabilities. Topics include issues of processes control system management, systems documentation, use of contractors and remote contractor access, system authorities that exceed user needs, misalignment of staff perception of information asset values, exposures related to use of USB ports, lack of encryption, and background surety gaps for individuals and contractor companies with access to process control systems. The paper examines the dynamics of communicating information from process control systems to business IT systems and the pressure from business operations to capture process data and make it available in near real-time through administrative networks. Such pressures may influence systems administrators to overlook or ignore firewall and systems engineering architecture, increasing potentials for two-way interface between business and process control that significantly increases exploit exposures. Despite the availability of excellent guidelines for physical and technical security of IT related assets, these practices are too often unheeded in favor of expediency or expanded access. The paper includes a discussion of Risk Management Framework models that should be considered to enhance the correspondences and relationships between multiple organizational domains, thereby promoting more effective cyber security for current and future process control systems. The paper summarizes the process for establishing security for industrial control systems (ICS), and addresses cyber security baseline requirements and expectations, within a risk management framework that provides a decision basis, threat dynamics, common vulnerabilities, and prudent mitigation measures. Much of this summary has been derived from The Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and NIST SP 800-82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security. NIST has also published Applying NIST SP 800-53 to Industrial Control Systems which demonstrates the relationship of 800-53 to ICS security and the application of more than 20 control families and over 625 control elements to ICS security. Although originally designed for Federal systems, portions of these publications also provide a solid foundation for critical commercial and industrial information control systems in terms of addressing the basic questions that companies in the process industry should consider when selecting security controls, including: • What controls are actually needed to protect process systems, while supporting operations and safeguarding critical assets? • Can the selected controls suggested for Federal systems effectively be implemented for systems in the process industry? • Once selected and implemented, will these controls really be effective in protecting the processes? NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, helps answer questions to strengthen commercial processes information security programs. The security controls articulated in NIST SP 800-53 provide guidance and recommend practices applicable to security systems in process industries, to provide a foundation for understanding the fundamental concepts of security controls. The introductory material presents the concept of security controls and their use within well-defined information security programs. Some of the issues discussed include the structural components of controls, how the controls are organized into families, and the use of controls to support information security programs. The guide outlines the essential steps that should be followed to determine needed controls, to assure the effectiveness of controls, and to maintain the effectiveness of installed controls. The appendices in NIST SP 800-53 provide additional resources including general references, definitions, explanation of acronyms, a breakdown of security controls for graduated levels of security requirements, a catalog of security controls, and information relating security controls to other standards and control sets. The controls are organized into classes of operational, management, and technical controls, and then into families within each class. To maintain parity and applicability with advances in technology, NIST also plans to review and to update the controls in the catalog as technology changes and new safeguards and new information security countermeasures are identified. NIST SP 800-53 and related documents are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html. The extensive reference list in SP 800-53 includes standards, guidelines, and recommendations that process industry companies can use as the foundation for comprehensive security planning and lifecycle management processes. Additionally, a significant effort of broad commercial and government cooperation, the Consensus Audit Guideline (CAG) provides a 20-element cyber security controls roster supporting a common commercial framework for cyber security, correlating to the NIST 800-53 Control Library. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Cyber-attacks can significantly hurt an organization's IT environment, leading to serious operational disruptions, from simply damaging the first layers of IT security up to identity theft, data leakage and breaking down networks. Moreover, the dangers through which current cybercrimes practices affect organizations present a tendency of developing more rapidly that decision makers can assess them and find countermeasures. Because cyber threats are somewhat new thus a critical source of risks, within the context of the constantly changing IT environments (e.g. cloud services integration) organizations may not effectively implement and manage cyber threat risk assessment processes. This paper highlights the importance of designing effective security strategies and proactively addressing cybercrime issues as key elements within the organizational risk management approaches. Malware rises constantly in impact and complexity and has surpassed the traditional security model. One of the main ideas of the study is to present the main areas of risks related to cyber security to which an organization is subject to and provide a baseline of an analysis model that would adequately evaluate input data, rank priorities and represent the results and solutions to decrease these risks. The importance of this study is to increase awareness efforts and to highlight the critical importance of using the full extent of resources provided. Each member of an organization has a significant role in decreasing the exposure to the vulnerabilities created by cyber-attacks. © 2006-2013 by CCC Publications.},

abstract={The events of September 11, 2001, increased and intensified domestic preparedness efforts in the United States against terrorism and other threats. The heightened focus on protecting this nation's critical infrastructure included legislation requiring implementation of extensive new security measures to better defend water supply systems against physical, chemical/ biological, and cyber attacks. In response, municipal officials have implemented numerous safeguards to reduce the vulnerability of these systems to purposeful intrusions including ongoing vulnerability assessments, extensive personnel training, and highly detailed emergency response and communication plans. This study evaluates fiscal year 2010 annual compliance assessments of public water systems with security measures that were implemented by Mississippi's Department of Health as a response to federal requirements to address these potential terrorist threats to water distribution systems. The results show that 20 percent of the water systems in this state had at least one security violation on their 2010 Capacity Development Assessment, and continued perseverance from local governments is needed to enhance the resiliency and robustness of these systems against physical threats. ©2012 by Weston Medical Publishing, LLC.},

abstract={The smart grid, generally referred to as the next generation power electric system, relies on robust information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide efficient, secure, and reliable information delivery. The implementation of the smart grid includes the deployment of multiple new infrastructures with vulnerabilities that have not yet been identified. Therefore, the traditional focus on security, reliability, compliance, and human safety is a paramount concern. This paper first addresses critical issues of smart grid primarily in terms of ICTs and standards. A risk-based approach has been presented, which could be implemented to address the security aspects and health impact of the smart grid. The paper evaluates the security threats to the smart grid as well as the health risks of smart meters currently under implementation in the context of radio frequency (RF) radiation. Finally, a combined framework for risk management in major technological and health domains has been proposed. Such a framework calls for a coordinated assessment of cyber and power grid risks keeping the whole grid security and safety goals in mind. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The U.S. electric power system has historically operated at such a high level of reliability that any major outage, either caused by sabotage, weather, or operational errors, makes news headlines. The transmission system is extensive, consisting mainly of transformers, switches, transmission towers and lines, control centers, and computer controls. A spectrum of threats exists to the electric system ranging from weather-related to terrorist attacks, including physical attacks, as well as attacks on computer systems, or cyber attacks. The main risk from weather-related damage or a terrorist attack against the electric power industry is a widespread power outage that lasts for an extended period of time. Of the transmission system's physical infrastructure, the high-voltage (HV) transformers are arguably the most critical component. Utilities rarely experience loss of an individual HV transformer, but recovery from such a loss takes months if no spare is available. Conversely, utilities regularly experience damage to transmission towers due to both weather and malicious activities, and are able to recover from this damage fairly rapidly. While occasionally causing blackouts, outages resulting from these attacks generally have not been widespread or long-lasting. Several options exist to mitigate vulnerabilities. Several groups have long proposed the stockpiling equipment as emergency replacements for critical units that do not currently have secure spares. However, some argue that a stockpile would be costly. Another option is to standardize the designs of permanent HV transformers to facilitate emergency recovery. Some have proposed revitalizing domestic manufacturing of HV transformers arguing that a reliance on foreign manufacturers would increase recovery time due to shipping time. However, others argue that the additional shipping time is not significant compared to overall manufacturing time. Threats against control systems may come from several different directions, such as state-sponsored attack, terrorist group attack, computer hacking, and worm or viral infection. However, the risk posed to industrial control systems from Internet-based attack is difficult to assess. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system vulnerability reduction may be achieved through several routes, including an increase in corporate and overall cyber-security, implementation of best-practices to bolster existing security functions in control system networks, stronger oversight and enforcement of security guidelines, and new technologies for secure control systems. Issues facing Congress include: What should be done to address vulnerabilities in the electric system? Who should be responsible for implementing appropriate actions? Who should pay? Should reliability guidelines or standards be implemented by the federal government or industry groups? And, who should be responsible for carrying out research and development to reduce vulnerabilities?. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the vulnerabilities of the cloud platform affecting businesses trading on the internet. It aims to examine the appropriateness of the cloud computing, its benefits to the industry and helps to identify security concerns for businesses that plan to deploy one of the cloud platforms. It helps to identify areas where businesses should focus before choosing an appropriate Cloud Service Provider (CSP). This paper presents the findings of an original research survey (200 IT professionals working both in the public and private sectors) undertaken to examine their privacy, and data security concerns associated with the cloud platform. Views of those who have yet to deploy cloud were analysed to detect the patterns of common security issues. Cyber fraud and trust concerns of the organisations are addressed and deployment of the secured cloud environment is outlined. The survey analysis highlighted that the top concerns for organisations on cloud were security (93.8 per cent), governance (61.1 per cent) and a lack of control over service availability (56.6 per cent). The survey highlighted that the majority of IT professionals were not aware that some CSPs currently control the decryption keys that enable them to decrypt their client's data. This should be considered as a major security concern and it is one of the factors that should be looked into while vetting the service level agreement (SLA). Data loss and leakage (73.5 per cent) were voted as the top threat to cloud computing by respondents; this was followed by account, service and traffic hijacking (60.8 per cent). The paper examines various types of cloud threats companies have encountered. The vast majority of the data are drawn from IT professionals with businesses mainly in the UK and the USA. The paper advocates a proactive and holistic cloud-cyber security prevention typology to prevent e-crime, with guidance of what features to look for when choosing an appropriate cloud service provider. This is the first analysis done that includes IT auditors, physical security personnel as well as IT professionals. The paper is of value to companies considering adoption or implementation of a cloud platform. It helps to assess the cloud by evaluating a detailed comparison of benefits and risk associated with the platform. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={As attackers get more coordinated and advanced in cyber attacks, cyber assets are required to have much more resilience, control effectiveness, and collaboration in networks. Such a requirement makes it essential to take a comprehensive and objective approach for measuring the individual and relative performances of cyber security assets in network nodes. To this end, this paper presents four techniques as to how the relative importance of cyber assets can be measured more comprehensively and objectively by considering together the main variables of risk assessment (e.g., threats, vulnerabilities), multiple attributes (e.g., resilience, control, and influence), network connectivity and controllability among collaborative cyber assets in networks. In the first technique, a Bayesian network is used to include the random variables for control, recovery, and resilience attributes of nodes, in addition to the random variables of threats, vulnerabilities, and risk. The second technique shows how graph matching and coloring can be utilized to form collaborative pairs of nodes to shield together against threats and vulnerabilities. The third technique ranks the security assets of nodes by incorporating multiple weights and thresholds of attributes into a decision-making algorithm. In the fourth technique, the hierarchically well-separated tree is enhanced to first identify critical nodes of a network with respect to their attributes and network connectivity, and then selecting some nodes as driver nodes for network controllability. © 2012 SPIE.},

abstract={The applications of computers and communication system and network technologies in nuclear power plants have expanded recently. This application of digital technologies to the instrumentation and control systems of nuclear power plants brings with it the cyber security concerns similar to other critical infrastructures. Cyber security risk assessments for digital instrumentation and control systems have become more crucial in the development of new systems and in the operation of existing systems. Although the instrumentation and control systems of nuclear power plants are similar to industrial control systems, the former have specifications that differ from the latter in terms of architecture and function, in order to satisfy nuclear safety requirements, which need different methods for the application of cyber security risk assessment. In this paper, the characteristics of nuclear power plant instrumentation and control systems are described, and the considerations needed when conducting cyber security risk assessments in accordance with the lifecycle process of instrumentation and control systems are discussed. For cyber security risk assessments of instrumentation and control systems, the activities and considerations necessary for assessments during the system design phase or component design and equipment supply phase are presented in the following 6 steps: 1) System Identification and Cyber Security Modeling, 2) Asset and Impact Analysis, 3) Threat Analysis, 4) Vulnerability Analysis, 5) Security Control Design, and 6) Penetration test. The results from an application of the method to a digital reactor protection system are described.},

abstract={Modern critical infrastructure systems are built on a hodgepodge of complex, interconnected information systems for control and management. For electric power, the critical infrastructure includes the physical systems; comprised of power generation, transmission and distribution capabilities. The control of the physical systems is accomplished via Supervisory Command and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The SCADA systems employ both new and legacy systems along with many of the same information system devices as traditional business information systems. SCADA system networks, just as business information system networks, are connected to external networks, including the Internet. Thus, SCADA systems are vulnerable to the same classes of threats as other networked computer systems in addition to threats associated with their legacy systems. Many of these systems have been put in place for decades and often have an unknown security posture. Cyber security analysis of these systems remains a significant challenge. Traditional techniques such as red-teaming, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing are often unsatisfactory and limited in scope because power utilities do not want to risk taking the systems off-line or degrading or damaging the expensive equipment. The consequence is that the effects of a cyber-attack on these SCADA systems are often unknown. In order to provide greater SCADA system security posture insight to utilities and administrators, security experts must perform security analysis. To overcome the problems with security analysis using either an exclusive hardware SCADA testbed or a simulation of a SCADA system, Sandia National Labs has developed a cyber-security analysis capability using physical hardware, extensive virtualization and emulated machines, and simulation to answer complex system questions about SCADA systems. In this paper we will discuss the methodology, several use-cases that were executed during the course of the study which leverage the methodology, the types of cyber-attacks that can be assessed and the class of questions security professionals can now ask and answer about cyber-attacks against SCADA systems. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The multiplication of access interfaces and technologies in Electric Power Utilities (EPUs) communication architectures and the smart grid developments, which will enable numerous new services with new traffic patterns, will change radically both network accesses and core architectures. This evolution could introduce new vulnerabilities to the reliability of electricity supply, based on the introduction and exposure of vulnerabilities in digital systems, architectures, and communications. This situation calls for new security requirements for digital systems and the underlying architecture used in EPUs. Security requirements have to be derived from appropriate risk assessments and general architectural decisions. Numerous existing cyber security standards provide guidance and use-cases which represent valuable inputs for the development of such requirements. The proliferation of standards suggests, however, that the existing documents either do not meet completely the needs of EPUs or are difficult to combine together. This paper focuses on two weak points of the existing cyber security standards in the area. Initially, the paper addresses the characterization, categorization and modeling of malicious cyber threats, which represent key steps in a risk assessment process. The paper presents a conceptual model expressing the meaning and the links between the key concepts of cyber security risks. Following this, the work examines attack modeling, addressing some pertinent technical and architectural issues. In addition, the paper explains why attack modeling is central to risk assessment and present graphical approaches to attack modeling. The second part the paper addresses the use of security architecture principles, notably the graded security approach as a fundamental framework to classify and structure a process of risk mitigation by security controls in both current and future EPU architectures. This discussion starts with the clarification of the terminology related to a graded security approach and then gives a general overview of the characteristics of known standards and best practices of graded security architectures. Following this, the paper presents an outlook of classification criteria to enable the implementation of a graded security approach in a real world environment and then illustrates the effectiveness and adaptability of a graded security approach in a real-world attack case.},

abstract={A range of common software components are gradually being integrated into the infrastructures that support safety-critical systems. These include network management tools, operating systems - especially Linux, Voice Over IP (VOIP) communications technologies, and satellite based augmentation systems for navigation/timing data etc. The increasing use of these common components creates concerns that bugs might affect multiple systems across many different safety-related industries. It also raises significant security concerns. Malware has been detected in power distribution, healthcare, military and transportation infrastructures. Most previous attacks do not seem to have deliberately targeted critical applications. However, there is no room for complacency in the face of increasing vulnerability to cyber attacks on safety-related systems. This paper illustrates the threat to air traffic management infrastructures and goes on to present a roadmap to increase our resilience to future CyberSafety attacks. Some components of this proposal are familiar concepts from Security Management Systems (SecMS), including a focus on incident reporting and the need for improved risk assessment tools. Other components of the roadmap focus on structural and organizational problems that have limited the effectiveness of existing SecMS; in particular there is a need to raise awareness amongst regulators and senior management who often lack the technical and engineering background to understand the nature of the threats to safety-critical software. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012.},

abstract={The Smart Grid is the roadmap for enhancing the infrastructure of every segment of the energy delivery system. This includes generation, transmission, distribution and consumption.The capabilities for smart grid systems and networks, such as distributed intelligence and broadband capabilities can greatly enhance effi ciency and reliability, but they may also create much new vulnerabilities if not deployed with the appropriate security controls. Much of the technology currently in use by the grid is outdated and in many cases unreliable. A system architecture implementing should recognize security threats and capture events that result not from external threats but from internal mistakes. An effective security approach enhances reliability. Security failure occurs from people, equipment, natural causes and deliberate failures A simple perimeter defense is not suffi cient; monitoring, both for events and physical actions, is required to bring the benefi ts of smart grid with minimal risk to this vital part of the infrastructure of modern life. This paper aims at fi nding out the security issues in Smart Grid and proposing solution architecture for that.

abstract={Technological advances have changed the manner in which ordinary citizens conduct their daily activities. Many of these activities are carried out over the Internet. These include filling tax returns, online banking, job searching and general socialising. Increased bandwidth and proliferation of mobile phones with access to Internet in South Africa imply increased access to Internet by the South African population. Such massive increased in access to Internet increases vulnerabilities to cyber crime and attacks and threatens the national security. As a result, South Africa remains one of top three countries that are targeted by phishing attacks, the other two are the US and the UK (RSA, 2011). As a response, various entities engage in cyber security awareness initiatieves and trainings with the aim to create cyber security awareness (CSA) among the citizens of South Africa. In the absence of a national cyber security policy, however, these awareness initiatives and programmes are delivered through a variety of independent mechanisms. Various entities engage in cyber security awareness training each with its specific objectives and focus areas. It is argued in this paper that cyber security is complex and multi-faceted. No single solution can effectively address it. While the current means to create cyber security awareness does make impact, the fragmented and uncoordinated nature thereof have a potential to create its own dynamics. The focus of organisations to deliver on their own objectives translates to some extent into the optimisation of the behaviour of individual entities as opposed to the optimisation of the national cyber security awareness as a whole. This paper evaluates the extent to which the current cyber security awareness initiatives address the cyber security threats and risks. The assessment is based on the initiatives objectives, alignment of the programme to the cyber threats, and the target audience.},

abstract={Complex network theory has brought novel concepts and methodology to the study of power network vulnerability, with significant results having been achieved over the past decade. Many countries are nowadays undergoing a revolution to a smart grid environment in which the smart grid will face increasing challenges arising from heavy reliance on cyber-infrastructure. In this environment, the smart grid will inevitably be exposed to a wide range of new security threats, e.g. cyber-Attacks. This paper begins by introducing some basic concepts from complex network theory. Next, error and attack tolerance methodology based analysis models are reviewed in detail. The smart grid framework is then formed as a cyber-physical system, in essence modeled as an interdependent complex network. Finally some suggestions are made for future vulnerability analyses of the smart grid.},

abstract={Information security is an imperative factor in organizational success, driven by the need to protect information assets. The continuous evolution of external and internal threats and the associated need to protect and secure information from exploitation of vulnerabilities has become a struggle for many organizations in both the public and private sectors. This struggle is the direct result of the narrow focus on operational security. Just as the lines between business and information technology have disappeared, so have the lines between business and information security. Some organizations simply "check the box" by performing the minimum actions required to pass or meet mandated compliance standards. Without practicing due diligence and by only meeting the minimum requirements, leads to the reactive response of exploited vulnerabilities in addition to the increase of after the fact incident investigations. Organizations need to take a proactive approach using established methodologies known to incorporate security into information technologies and systems. The Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) is a solution oriented methodology for any business enterprise that seeks to enable its information infrastructure by applying security solutions within every layer of the organization. This article describes how SABSA can be integrated into organizations' existing architectures utilizing organizational business drivers. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Web security threats as the immoral, the cyber-crime which threaten the electronic commerce are increased in the reversed side of the convenience of WWW. Therefore, it is necessary to establish and apply the countermeasure in electronic commerce activities. It is very important to manage the key safely in order to provide the security web services which are the confidentiality, the authentication, the repudiation and so on. It needs the convenient key management system to provide the proper security service to electronic commerce activities. PKI-based key management system which a certificate is applied in is used widely for HTTPS. We can find the vulnerabilities of certificate application in a lot of web security products. This paper studies the vulnerability cases of the certificate application which we have found frequently in the real environment or at web security products. And this paper proposes the security requirements of the certificate when it uses in practical application. These security requirements which are proposed by this paper can be useful in the area of the validation of a certificate when the PKI based key management system is established. These security requirements can be used as a development guideline of a web security product developer in the area of the validation of a certificate. Also, they can be used as an evaluation criteria of a web security products in the area of the validation of a certificate when an evaluator assessments the web security products. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The paper summarises the results of research activities, both methodological and experimental, performed by RSE to evaluate the exposition to cyber risks of the power grid control systems. On the methodological side a risk metric has been defined assigning a value to the cyber/power risk in relation to the occurrence rate of cyber contingencies and their impact on the power service. The higher criticality threats have been experimented in the RSE Laboratory by simulating selected attack processes on telecontrol test beds of passive interconnected HV/MV distribution grids. The experiments concern cyber threats to ICT network components, such as routers and SCADA systems, having a critical role in power grid operation. The experiments assessed the residual vulnerabilities of protected IEC 60870-5-104 TCP/IP based communications between Control Centres and Substation Automation Systems in presence of attack processes assuming different degrees of knowledge about the attacked system's behaviour. The evaluation framework supporting the experimental activity allows monitoring the communication status through a set of measurements such as Inter Message Time, Number of Lost Messages, Inter Reconnection Time and Time To Failure. The knowledge and measures from controlled experiments are then exploited by the cyber-risk metrics to improve the estimation of the vulnerability and threat probabilities related to the successfulness of a given attack. © 2011 IEEE.},

FUZZBUSTER uses a suite of fuzz testing and vulnerability assessment tools to find or verify the existence of vulnerabilities. Then FUZZBUSTER conducts additional tests to characterize the extent of the vulnerability, identifying ways it can be triggered. After characterizing a vulnerability, FUZZBUSTER synthesizes and applies an adaptation to prevent future exploits. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber crimes and cyber terrorism are becoming increasingly menacing and the latter has been identified as a distinct threat requiring attention. At the 21st Aviation Security Panel Meeting of ICAO (AVSECP/21, 22 to 26 March 2010) a new Recommended Practice related to cyber threats was proposed for adoption by the Council as part of amendment 12 to Annex 17 (Security) to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention). It was adopted on 17 November 2010, will become effective on 26 March 2011 and applicable on 1 July 2011. This Recommended Practice suggests that each Contracting State develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation. At the 22nd Meeting of the Panel, conducted by ICAO from 21 to 25 March 2011, the Panel noted the value of vulnerability assessments pertaining to cyber security in aviation whose objectives are to evaluate the efficiency of existing mitigation measures and identify any vulnerabilities from a threat-based perspective and further noted that better understanding of residual risks will support a State's efforts to refine its risk response. This article contains an analysis of what cyber crimes are as against cyber terrorism, measures taken to counter the threat along with a legal analysis of the threat as it affects aviation and addresses several issues, including a discussion on some national efforts at curbing the problem in some prominent jurisdictions. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The likelihood of cyber threats to critical infrastructures has been increasing in this last decade with the deployment of advanced automation and communication technologies relying on standardized protocols. The paper summarises the results of research activities, both methodological and experimental, performed in National and European research projects to evaluate the exposition to cyber risks of the power grid control systems. On the methodological side a risk metric has been defined assigning a value to the cyber-power risk in relation to the occurrence rate of cyber contingencies and their impact on the power service. The higher ranking threats have been experimented by simulating selected attack processes on a telecontrol test bed of interconnected distribution grids. The test bed includes a set of security mechanisms positioned at different layers of the ICT (Information and Communication Technology) architecture. The experiments covered cyber threats to ICT network components, such as routers and SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems, having a critical role in power grid operation and assessed the residual vulnerabilities of protected IEC 60870-5-104 communications in presence of attack processes based on different degrees of knowledge of the target system's behaviour. Both simple denial of service attacks and complex intrusion processes have been deployed in the test bed and their impact evaluated during normal and emergency operation. An attack process consists of a sequence of intrusion steps along a compromise path in the control network topology, its purpose being the manipulation of the information flows of process status data, events and commands. In complex intrusion scenarios the attacker is presumed to have a detailed knowledge of the target systems and their communication profiles. S/he forces the protective barriers deployed at different layers of the ICT architecture thus gaining access to sensitive connections in order to arbitrarily modify the state of the power system. Performance measures have been extracted by the communication logs recorded during the attack experiments. The knowledge and measures derived from the attack experiments have been integrated into the cyber-risk metric to improve the estimation of the vulnerability and threat probabilities related to the successfulness of a given attack. The rationale underlying the application of the methodology to smarter distribution grids of the future is illustrated through a sample use case.},

From the viewing side of information flow, there are management and protection of the system that must be strategized to ensure the effective operation of the energy delivery system. This cyber security strategy will examine both domain-specific and common requirement to ensure interoperability of solution across different part of infrastructure. This strategy will require risk management framework developed by both private and public sector. This framework will establish the processes for combining impact, vulnerability, and threat information to produce an assessment of risk to the distributed energy delivery system. The approach of this risk management will consider an organizational perspective, cyber security requirement, standard security system, and electricity security guideline and protection plan. This risk management will be applied on an asset, system, and network basis, as applicable. Some security architecture such as key management, virtualization security within cloud computing, and smart privacy will be linked to the energy delivery system. The final strategy of this effort will be a set of recommended cyber security requirements that will be allocated to interfaces of the Smart Grid. The goal is to ensure that a comprehensive assessment of the systems and component of the distributed energy delivery system is completed. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Many research projects studying security threats require realistic network scenarios while dealing with millions of cyber threats (e.g., exploit programs and malware). For instance, studying the execution of malware may require to take into account different network configurations in which malware can propagate, as well as dealing with thousands (or millions) of different malware samples. The same challenge occurs if one wants to evaluate IDSs, study exploit programs or conduct vulnerability assessment using realistic network scenarios. Moreover, cyber threats are highly dynamic. Every day, new vulnerabilities are identified and documented in software commonly used by computers connected to the Internet, and new malware instances and exploit programs are also identified. Consequently, it is not viable to develop (deploy) an environment every time cyber threats or security products (e.g., IDSs and anti-virus) have to be studied from a different perspective. New research methodologies and tools are needed to systematically conduct cyber security research. Automation is required to deal with the increasingly large number of cyber threats. In this paper, we draw the foundations of an experimental approach to cyber security by providing the blueprints of a lightweight Automated Experimentation System (AES). The AES automatically executes experiments based on a specification file. We describe its usage in different network security research projects, from IDS evaluation to static and dynamic malware analysis. The results we derived from these different research projects show that our experimental approach to cyber security, enabled by the AES, enhances the scope (and scale) of research in this field. Consequently, the AES improves our understanding of cyber threats and our assessment of the current state of security products. © 2011 ACM.},

The same percentage believes the industry's vulnerability has risen over the last 12 mo. According to Stewart Baker, who led the study for CSIS, the adoption of security measures in important civilian industries has badly trailed the increase in threats. Over the last year, the energy sector has increased its adoption of security technologies by only a single percentage point (51%). Oil and gas were little better, increasing by just three percentage points (48%). One critical assessment of the lack of cyber security was provided by Jim Woolsey, former US director of central intelligence. According to Woolsey, 90-95% of the people working on the smart grid are not concerned about security and only see it as a last box they have to check.},

Critical infrastructure companies need to examine their systems looking for vulnerabilities, determine the consequences/impacts to the company's operations of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability, and determine the capabilities that are necessary to successfully exploit the vulnerability. Another area where critical infrastructure companies can gather information, used to convince managers to authorize the implementation of cybersecurity defenses, is to examine real-world industrial incidents and see if a purely cyber scenario resulting in the same consequences can be extrapolated.},

abstract={Critical infrastructures and systems are today exposed not only to traditional safety and availability problems, but also to new kinds of security threats. These are mainly due to the large number of new vulnerabilities and architectural weaknesses introduced by the extensive use of information and communication technologies (ICT) into such complex systems. In this paper we present the outcomes of an exhaustive ICT security assessment, targeting an operational power plant, which consisted also of the simulation of potential cyber attacks. The assessment shows that the plant is considerably vulnerable to malicious attacks. This situation cannot be ignored, because the potential outcomes of an induced plant malfunction can be severe. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Power grid information security and protection has aspects of both Industrial Control Systems (ICS) as well as Information Technology (IT) Systems. Although both ICS and IT systems require information security services to combat malicious attacks, the specifics of how these services are used for the power grid depend upon appropriate risk assessment and risk control. Distinct types of attacks targeting ICS and IT systems as well as different performance requirements of these systems determine a specific priority order of the security services implemented for each system. Threat profiles of the power transmission and distribution management functions, where availability is paramount to all other security services, differ significantly from threat profiles of IT functions such as utility customer billing where confidentiality is a greater concern - hence warranting different security posturing. This paper discusses different approaches for security risk management in the context of the smart power grid. Methodologies proposed for risk assessment include threat and vulnerability modeling schemes which help in identifying and categorizing the threats, as well as in analyzing their impacts, and subsequently prioritizing them. Risk management planning techniques as they apply to both ICS and IT systems are also discussed. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In most organizations, IT (information technology) infrastructure exists to support the organization's mission. The threat of cyber attacks poses risks to this mission. Current network security research focuses on the threat of cyber attacks to the organization's IT infrastructure; however, the risks to the overall mission are rarely analyzed or formalized. This connection of IT infrastructure to the organization's mission is often neglected or carried out ad-hoc. Our work bridges this gap and introduces analyses and formalisms to help organizations understand the mission risks they face from cyber attacks. Modeling an organization's mission vulnerability to cyber attacks requires a description of the IT infrastructure (network model), the organization mission (business model), and how the mission relies on IT resources (correlation model). With this information, proper analysis can show which cyber resources are of tactical importance in a cyber attack, i.e., controlling them enables a large range of cyber attacks. Such analysis also reveals which IT resources contribute most to the organization's mission, i.e., lack of control over them gravely affects the mission. These results can then be used to formulate IT security strategies and explore their trade-offs, which leads to better incident response. This paper presents our methodology for encoding IT infrastructure, organization mission and correlations, our analysis framework, as well as initial experimental results and conclusions. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

Despite growing awareness of security issues especially in SCADA networks, there exist little or scarce information about SCADA vulnerabilities and attacks. The emergence of Internet and World Wide Web technologies integrated with business systems brought a growing concern about the security and safety of the SCADA control systems. This research aims to addresses the issues regarding security and vulnerability testing. Software program was created to simulate the vulnerability testing and carry out assessment methodologies to test existing SCADA software design and implementation. This paper provides an analysis of potential software vulnerabilities, and security concerns including recommendations toward improving security for SCADA control systems. It also provides recommendations on key requirements and features needed for the enhancement of security for SCADA control systems.},

abstract={This paper reflects the content of the Technical Brochure (TB), covering the efforts of Working Group WG D2.22 "Treatment of Information Security for Electric Power Utilities (EPUs)". The TB is published during 2010. The work has been carried out between 2006 and 2009. The WG D2.22 is the successor of Joint Working Group (JWG) D2/B3/C2-01 on "Security for Information Systems and Intranets in Electric Power System" (2003 - 2006/2007). The WG D2.22 has focussed and deepened the study on the following three issues: • Frameworks for EPUs on how to manage information security, • Risk assessment (RA) and Risk Management (RM): Common models and methods for treating vulnerabilities, threats and attacks, and • Security technologies for SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems/control systems including real time control networks. As intermediate results, the WG D2.22 has produced six papers, published in Electra and at Cigré Session and Colloquium. It is concluded that an overall security framework should be based on existing standards and "best practices", taking into account legal and regulatory requirements. A framework should be based on risk assessment. The technical solution should be based on a domain model and technical security controls consistently assigned with the domain definition. The selection of the "proper" standard(s) is delicate, and an up-to-date and critical vision of the fast-moving landscape is necessary. It is evident that information security for an EPU will continue to be an important issue, in both the short and long run. As natural further works, the following are proposed: 1) To improve methods for use of security frameworks and deploying risk assessment and management methods; 2) To provide guidance on how to more deeply involve and get acceptance from top level management regarding the importance of information and IT security; 3) To provide guidance on how to embed information security as a natural and mandatory part through all phases of a project, from specification through acceptance, and throughout the operational life of a system.},

Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is an advanced "cyber-physical" concept that can help meet such targets by enabling highly accurate air traffic surveillance. However, beneficial, confident application of ADS-B requires a foundational understanding of vulnerabilities and mitigation requirements. This paper focuses on the assessment and mitigation of threats from unauthorized access and unanticipated disruption of ADS-B communications. We present a solution to protect message integrity in ADS-B IN based airborne surveillance, discuss the accuracy and robustness of the solution in the presence of spoofed or compromised nodes and intentional jamming. To study effects of "intelligent jamming" strategies on ADS-B, visualize and analyze system-wide impact, we propose a security simulation tool concept and design. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The integration of cyberspace and space systems development and operations activities has become essential to the successful achievement of Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Net-Centric mission requirements. In general, approaches to Air Force risk management and cybersecurity have focused largely on the implementation of technology as reactive mechanisms in the operational environment. The importance of proactively addressing the risks associated with space/cyberspace integration at any point in the system development lifecycle (SDLC) and iteratively re-addressing those risks throughout the SDLC has become even greater in the face of continually evolving cyberspace threats. In response to this situation, an approach to threat and vulnerability assessments has been developed to conduct risk identification, analysis, handling, and monitoring iteratively throughout the SDLC for the Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Systems Wing (MCSW) portfolio of programs. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Terminal Engineering Office (JTEO) emphasizes proactive end to end terminal engineering analysis that is critical to the success of terminal acquisition programs (systems development) and the operational (warfighter) mission. This paper presents the JTEO's approach to addressing cyber-based threats and vulnerabilities to MILSATCOM systems, architectures, and Joint terminal development that integrates both qualitative and quantitative engineering analyses for improved decision-making regarding the effectiveness of and return on investment (ROI) from terminal requirements. The JTEO approach to threat, vulnerability and risk assessment adapts MCSW and AFSPC enterprise risk management strategies by identifying cyberspace threats to the terminal segment and supporting the mitigation of those threats during systems engineering, development, systems integration, test and evaluation, and information assurance (IA) certification and accreditation (C&A) and supplying the results of those efforts to the enterprise. The JTEO cybersecurity initiatives support the terminal C&A process and can also support the process by which terminals may gain approval to connect to MILSATCOM systems, and potentially, through those MILSATCOM systems, to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN)/Global Information Grid (GIG). ©2010 IEEE.},

Cyber security assessment was conducted on ICS (Industrial control systems) of different companies for a period of four years and several vulnerabilities were identified. Main problems included use of weak encryption, standard protocols and information disclosure using unencrypted communication among ICS hosts on the network. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, a hacker could alter the communication between ICS and controlled equipment, resulting in malfunction. Overcoming these vulnerabilities is essential in order to protect the vital power sector in any country of the world.

abstract={For enhancement of the security of physical assets at Bapco, a number of engineering projects were identified. These were at various stages of analysis and implementation when a decision was made to conduct a formal Security Vulnerability Assessment (SVA). A risk assessment study was carried out aimed at prioritization of the assets involved and potential enhancement measures. Security Department and security consultants (with participation of government security advisors) had previously carried out similar analyses and studies, and this risk assessment study was done as an extension to those studies. Included were core-business physical assets only. Cyber/data/information security, executive and personnel security, and non-core assets security were considered beyond the scope of this study. The methodology adopted herein has been based on that published in May 2003 by the American Petroleum Institute (API) in conjunction with the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association (NPRA) entitled: Security Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) Methodology for the Petroleum and Petrochemical Industries |1|. Also, the latest version of this API document (revised October 2004) was briefly checked while finalizing this paper. The method is similar to the one published previously by the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) |2| |3|. API's SVA process consists of the following five main steps: Step 1: Asset Characterization (critical assets, functions, and existing measures) Step 2: Threat Assessment Step 3: Vulnerability Analysis Step 4: Risk Assessment Step 5: Countermeasures Analysis Risk assessment was carried out in the form of risk ranking on a standard 5 x 5 matrix of likelihood and severity; it required judgment calls made by subject-matter experts. The API recommends an SVA team approach to assess rankings -in particular, the "likelihood" rankings require input from security professionals who have access to confidential information related to adversary types, adversary capabilities, past incidents, and target attractiveness compared to others in the region. Furthermore, unlike safety risk assessment, the threat types and likelihood rankings in SVA can drastically change from time to time. For example, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses a color-coded advisory system and issues current threat level bulletins for use by various states and industries. At the time of writing this paper, the general threat level in the U.S. was specified as "yellow" or "elevated - significant risk of terrorist attack." It should be noted that if a proposed security project can result in direct savings (for example, a reduction in the number of security patrols required) then justification for that needs to be developed on the basis of normal economic benefit methods such as those carried out for other profit projects. Security risk assessment and risk-based cost-benefit analysis for such a project is not required. In conducting this risk assessment, each project has been treated as "stand-alone," i.e., no synergistic benefit has been assumed for implementing more than one project concurrently. This assumption is not valid in some cases. Results from this risk analysis are summarized in the form of a table listing the risk ranking derived from the SVA. For each pair of severity and likelihood ratings, a combined risk rating is calculated using the default values built into the commercially available software called PHAWORKS (used for generating worksheets for individual security enhancement projects) |4|. The overall risk ratings are then combined into a measure called Risk Prioritization Factor (RPF) - the "before," "after," and "gain" values of RPF associated with each project are listed in this paper. To develop the concept of prioritization further, a risk-reduction to cost ratio has been calculated (RPF gain was multiplied by 100 and divided by the cost factor). Note that for this SVA, the adversary types were limited to the following seven categories: 1 Foreign government or foreign government-backed terrorist 2 Terrorist group in collusion with insider 3 Terrorist group 4 Disgruntled employee or contractor 5 Professional criminals 6 Vandals 7 Horseplay/mischief.

Yet modern security tools present an unusually consequential threat to business continuity - too much rather than too little information on cyber problems is presented, harking back to a phenomenon cited by social scientists in the 1960s called 'information overload'. Experience indicates that the longer the most serious cyber problems go untreated, the wider the attack surface adversaries can find. One technique used at the Department of State, called 'risk scoring', resulted in an 89 per cent overall reduction in measured risk over 12 months for the Department of State's servers and personal computers. Later refinements of risk scoring enabled technicians to correct unique security threats with unprecedented speed. This paper explores how the use of metrics, special care in presenting information to technicians and executives alike, as well as tactical use of organisational incentives can result in stronger cyber defences protecting modern organisations.},

abstract={The use of digital technologies has introduced a cyber security problem and it has been one of the current issues in the I&C area of the U.S. NRC for the last decade. Finally, NRC published regulatory guide R.G 1.152, Revision 02, and it has been a trigger for this concern. The new regulatory requirement for cyber security should be systematically and considerably incorporated into an I&C system design and therefore it is necessary to develop a cyber security program, policies and detailed plans in accordance with the guides. In order to develop the detailed design requirements for safety related I&C systems, a cyber security risk assessment is conducted in this study. The assessment consists of a target system analysis, an asset analysis, a threat analysis, a vulnerability analysis, a risk analysis, confirming the analyzed risks through intrusion tests, and recommending technologies and strategies for responses. These procedures and detailed methods are modified from those of IT industries. Based on the results of the assessment, cyber security policies and detailed procedures for each design stage are established. For addressing a whole l&C, the same assessment should also be conducted for a non-safety I&C including information processing and monitoring systems.},

abstract={DuPont Corp.'s propriety DuPont Network Security Assessment Methodology (DNSAM) is designed to conduct vulnerability assessment to protect a pipeline system from cyber threat. DNSAM's basic concept works on the justified assumption that a cyber attack needs a communication path between and attacker and the critical cyber assets. A variation of the DNSAM approach is possibly an acceptable methodology for conducting a pipeline SCADA system risk assessment. A pure DNSAM assessment approach usually ignores communication channels not supporting routable protocols, allowing intermediate computers to receive messages addressed to other computers and attempt to pass them along to the actual addressee. A cyber attack on a pipeline's SCADA system is probably not meant to harm the SCADA system but rather use the SCADA system to induce actions harmful to the pipeline and associated facilities. SCADA systems are also generally fault-tolerant, and major pipeline may even have a physically separated alternate-site SCADA system.},

abstract={Gas pipelines have become potential targets of terrorists worldwide, thus necessitating the need to place robust cyber security systems to protect them. The US government has already determined pipelines that are potential targets for terrorism. A cyber security risk assessment is premised on the presumption that a hostile attack will be made to generate maximum damage through compromising the automation systems. Evaluating the consequences of a given asset being disabled, disrupted, or otherwise made inaccessible will allow further differentiation of critical assets like software, information- documentation, and a local or wide-area communications infrastructure. A risk assessment allows to recognize parameters for estimating the impact of a successful attack against a critical asset. A commercially available assessment methodology and associated tools can formalize the process of making a vulnerability assessment. Passive vulnerability assessments examine the available communication paths into critical cyber assets, reviewing known computer and communication system vulnerabilities before applying fault-tree analysis.},

abstract={Current trends indicate that IT security measures will need to greatly expand to counter the ever increasingly sophisticated, well-funded and/or economically motivated threat space. Traditional risk management approaches provide an effective method for guiding courses of action for assessment, and mitigation investments. However, such approaches no matter how popular demand very detailed knowledge about the IT security domain and the enterprise/cyber architectural context. Typically, the critical nature and/or high stakes require careful consideration and adaptation of a balanced approach that provides reliable and consistent methods for rating vulnerabilities. As reported in earlier works, the Cyberspace Security Econometrics System provides a comprehensive measure of reliability, security and safety of a system that accounts for the criticality of each requirement as a function of one or more stakeholders' interests in that requirement. This paper advocates a dependability measure that acknowledges the aggregate structure of complex system specifications, and accounts for variations by stakeholder, by specification components, and by verification and validation impact. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In the case of unauthorized individuals, systems and entities or process threatening the instrumentation and control systems of nuclear facilities using the intrinsic vulnerabilities of digital based technologies, those systems may lose their own required functions. The loss of required functions of the systems can seriously affect the safety of nuclear facilities. Consequently, digital instrumentation and control systems, which perform functions important to safety, should be designed and operated to respond to cyber threats capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of digital based technologies. To make it possible, the developers and licensees of nuclear facilities should perform appropriate cyber security activities throughout the whole life cycle of digital instrumentation and control systems. Under the goal of securing the safety of nuclear facilities, this paper presents the regulatory on cyber security activities to remove the cyber threats that exploit the vulnerabilities of digital instrumentation and control systems and to mitigate the effect of such threats.

abstract={Much research has been put forth towards detection, correlating, and prediction of cyber attacks in recent years. As this set of research progresses, there is an increasing need for contextual information of a computer network to provide an accurate situational assessment. Typical approaches adopt contextual information as needed; yet such ad hoc effort may lead to unnecessary or even conflicting features. The concept of virtual terrain is, therefore, developed and investigated in this work. Virtual terrain is a common representation of crucial information about network vulnerabilities, accessibilities, and criticalities. A virtual terrain model encompasses operating systems, firewall rules, running services, missions, user accounts, and network connectivity. It is defined as connected graphs with arc attributes defining dynamic relationships among vertices modeling network entities, such as services, users, and machines. The virtual terrain representation is designed to allow feasible development and maintenance of the model, as well as efficacy in terms of the use of the model. This paper will describe the considerations in developing the virtual terrain schema, exemplary virtual terrain models, and algorithms utilizing the virtual terrain model for situation and threat assessment.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new approach for assessing the organization's vulnerability to information-security breaches. Although much research has been done on qualitative approaches, the literature on numerical approaches to quantify information-security risk is scarce. This paper suggests a method to quantify risk in terms of a numeric value or "degree of cybersecurity". To help quantitatively measure the level of cybersecurity for a computer-based information system, we present two indices, the threat-impact index and the cyber-vulnerability index, based on vulnerability trees. By calculating and comparing the indices for various possible security enhancements, managers can select the best security enhancement choice, prioritize the choices by their relative effectiveness, and statistically justify spending resources on the selected choice. By qualifying information security quantitatively, the method can also help managers establish a specific target of security level that they can track. We illustrate the use of the proposed methodology on the security of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems using data from the SCADA system test bed implemented at the University of Louisville as a case study, and then show the use of the proposed indices on this information system before and after two security enhancements. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The continuous growth of cyber security threat s and attacks including the increasing sophistication of malware is impacting the security of critical infrastructure, industrial control systems, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) control systems. The reliable operation of modern infrastructures depends on computerized systems and SCADA systems. Since the emergence of Internet and World Wide Web technologies, these systems were integrated with business systems and became more exposed to cyber threats. There is a growing concern about the security and safety of the SCADA control systems. The Presidential Decision Directive 63 document est ablished the framework to protect the critical infrastruct ure an d the Presidential document of 2003, the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace stated that securing SCADA systems is a national priority. T he critical infrastructure includes telecommunication, transportation, energy, banking, finance, water supply, emergency services, government services, agriculture, an d other fundamental systems and services that are critical to the security, economic prosperity, and social well-being of the public. The critical infrastructure is characterized by interdependencies (physical, cyber, geographic, and logical) and complexity (collections of interacting components). Therefore, information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems without exception. Critical infrastructure disruptions can directly an d indirectly affect other infrastructures, impact large geographic regions, an d send ripples throughout the national an d global economy. For example, under normal operating conditions, the electric power in frastructure requires fuels (natural gas and petroleum), transportation, water, banking and finance, telecommunication, and SCADA systems for monitoring and control. In this paper, we provide an analysis of key developments, architecture, potential vulnerabilities, and security concerns including recommendations toward improving security for SCADA control systems. We discuss the most important issues concerning the security of SCADA systems including a perspective on enhancing security of these systems. We briefly describe the SCADA architecture, and identify t he attributes that increase the complexity of these systems including the key developments that mark the evolution of the SCADA control systems along with the growth of potential vulnerabilities and security concerns. Then, we provide recommendations toward an enhanced security for SCADA control systems. More efforts should be planned on reducing the vulnerabilities and improving the security operations of these systems. It is necessary to address not only t he individual vulnerabilit ies, but the breadth of risks that can interfere with critical operations. We describe key requirements and features needed to improve the security of t he current SCADA control systems. For example, in assessing the risk for SCADA systems, use of general methods for risk analysis including specific conditions and characteristics of a control system need to be applied. Effective risk analysis for SCADA systems requires a unified definition for mishap an d identification of potential harm to safety. As computer systems are more integrated, the distinction between security and safety is beginning to disappear. In bridging the gap between these domains, we propose a unified risk framework which combines a new definition of mishap with an expanded definition of hazard to include the security event. However, methods for risk management that are based on automated tools and intelligent techniques are more beneficial to SCADA systems because they require minimum or no human intervention in controlling the processes. We also identify a unified security/safety risk framework for control systems. Implementing security features ensures higher security, reliability, an d availability of control systems. Thus organizations need to reassess the SCADA control systems an d risk model to achieve in depth defense solutions for these systems. The increasing threats against SCADA control systems indicate that there should be more directions in the development of these systems. Therefore, achieving better quality an d more secure SCADA control systems is a high priority. Information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems with out exception. We conclude with a thought about the future of SCADA control systems. A strategy to deal with cyber attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure requires first understanding the full nature of the threat. A depth defense and proactive solutions to improve the security of SCADA control systems ensures the future of control systems and survivability of critical infrastructure.},

abstract={This paper presents an approach enabling economic modelling of information security risk management in contemporaneous businesses and other organizations. In the world of permanent cyber attacks to ICT systems, risk management is becoming a crucial task for minimization of the potential risks that can endeavor their operation. The prevention of the heavy losses that may happen due to cyber attacks and other information system failures in an organization is usually associated with continuous investment in different security measures and purchase of data protection systems. With the rise of the potential risks the investment in security services and data protection is growing and is becoming a serious economic issue to many organizations and enterprises. This paper analyzes several approaches enabling assessment of the necessary investment in security technology from the economic point of view. The paper introduces methods for identification of the assets, the threats, the vulnerabilities of the ICT systems and proposes a procedure that enables selection of the optimal investment of the necessary security technology based on the quantification of the values of the protected systems. The possibility of using the approach for an external insurance based on the quantified risk analyses is also provided. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper develops a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber security breach reporting laws across states. In doing so, trends and correlations in state reporting along with other relevant factors are identified using readily available data. This paper addresses two critical questions in the assessment of breach reporting legislation: 1) How does the rate of reporting security breaches across states compare with the rate of reporting of security threats to computer operating systems?, and 2) What factors other than the implementation of breach reporting legislation effect the rate of reporting security breaches across states? The framework developed in this paper can be applied in future analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of breach reporting legislation and can assist in pinpointing legislative weaknesses across states. Limitations in the availability of data inspired the generation of a number of recommendations for the improvement of breach reporting law evaluation. First, more time is needed to collect data, as most laws have been in place for two or fewer years. Second, each state should have a central database that records all reported cyber security breaches. This will allow for greater visibility to the public and would make for greater accessibility of data for both consumers and researchers. Finally, further research efforts should be conducted on the topic of OS security vulnerability patch rates and their relevance to the actual, realized cyber threat level of operating systems.},

abstract={An information technology-driven organization, in which most business is carried out and its revenue is presented through information technology, increasingly provides their key functions through computer systems and networks. These kinds of environments have prompted every day cyber threats through computer technology and Internet infrastructure. Current issues are rising for the matter of risk analysis on information technology transactions. To fulfil accurate risk estimation of this, different approaches are required to consider what each information asset is and what cyber vulnerabilities it is open to. In order to succeed, first it is necessary to identify its model of information asset, unlike conventional assets where each asset can be figured out as a whole value, then measure the value of it. In this paper, we are trying to show the methods and approaches to applying risk analysis to the information technology field. Hereafter, we identify key elements consisting of assets of a computer system. After its completion, we create a mathematic function to calculate its value based on the asset elements.

However, as the level of complexity and connectivity in information systems increases, effective monitoring of computer networks is getting harder. Systems for efficient threat identification and assessment are needed in order to handle high-speed traffic and monitor data in an appropriate manner. We discuss attacks relating to critical infrastructure, specifically on the Internet. The term critical infrastructure refers to both systems in the digital domain and systems that interface with critical infrastructure in the physical world. Examples of a digital critical infrastructure are the DNS (domain name service) and the routing infrastructure on the Internet. Examples of systems that interface with the physical world are control systems for power grids and telecommunications systems. In 1988, the first Internet worm (called the Morris worm) disabled thousands of hosts and made the Internet almost unusable. In 2002, the DNS root servers were attacked by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack specifically directed at these servers, threatening to disrupt the entire Internet.1 As our critical infrastructure, including telecommunication systems and power grids, becomes more connected and dependent on digital systems, we risk the same types of attacks being used as weapons in information warfare or cyber terrorism. Any digital system or infrastructure has a number of vulnerabilities with corresponding threats. These threats can potentially exploit vulnerabilities, causing unwanted incidents. In the case of critical infrastructures, the consequences of such vulnerabilities being exploited can become catastrophic. In this chapter, we discuss methods relating to the monitoring, detection, and identification of such attacks through the use of monitoring systems. We refer to the data-capturing device or software as a sensor. The main threats considered in this chapter are information warfare and cyber terrorism. These threats can lead to several different scenarios, such as coordinated computer attacks, worm attacks, DDoS attacks, and large scale scanning and mapping efforts. In this context, the primary task of network monitoring is to detect and identify unwanted incidents associated with threats in order to initiate appropriate precautionary measures and responses. © 2008, IGI Global.},

abstract={Proven set of best practices for security risk assessment and management, explained in plain English This guidebook sets forth a systematic, proven set of best practices for security risk assessment and management of buildings and their supporting infrastructures. These practices are all designed to optimize the security of workplace environments for occupants and to protect the interests of owners and other stakeholders. The methods set forth by the authors stem from their research at Sandia National Laboratories and their practical experience working with both government and private facilities. Following the authors' step-by-step methodology for performing a complete risk assessment, you learn to: Identify regional and site-specific threats that are likely and credible Evaluate the consequences of these threats, including loss of life and property, economic impact, as well as damage to symbolic value and public confidence Assess the effectiveness of physical and cyber security systems and determine site-specific vulnerabilities in the security system The authors further provide you with the analytical tools needed to determine whether to accept a calculated estimate of risk or to reduce the estimated risk to a level that meets your particular security needs. You then learn to implement a risk-reduction program through proven methods to upgrade security to protect against a malicious act and/or mitigate the consequences of the act. This comprehensive risk assessment and management approach has been used by various organizations, including the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bonneville Power Administration, and numerous private corporations, to assess and manage security risk at their national infrastructure facilities. With its plain-English presentation coupled with step-by-step procedures, flowcharts, worksheets, and checklists, you can easily implement the same proven approach and methods for your organization or clients. © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract={The growing dependence of critical infrastructures and industrial automation on interconnected physical and cyber-based control systems has resulted in a growing and previously unforeseen cyber security threat to supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and distributed control systems (DCSs). It is critical that engineers and managers understand these issues and know how to locate the information they need. This paper provides a broad overview of cyber security and risk assessment for SCADA and DCS, introduces the main industry organizations and government groups working in this area, and gives a comprehensive review of the literature to date. Major concepts related to the risk assessment methods are introduced with references cited for more detail. Included are risk assessment methods such as HHM, IIM, and RFRM which have been applied successfully to SCADA systems with many interdependencies and have highlighted the need for quantifiable metrics. Presented in broad terms is probability risk analysis (PRA) which includes methods such as FTA, ETA, and FEMA. The paper concludes with a general discussion of two recent methods (one based on compromise graphs and one on augmented vulnerability trees) that quantitatively determine the probability of an attack, the impact of the attack, and the reduction in risk associated with a particular countermeasure. © 2007 ISA.},

abstract={The US infrastructure is continually challenged by hostile nation states and others who would do us harm. Cyber vulnerabilities and weaknesses are potential targets and are the result of years of construction and technological improvement in a world less concerned with security than is currently the case. As a result, cyber attack presents a class of challenges for which we are just beginning to prepare. What has been done in the nuclear, chemical and energy sectors as a means of anticipating and preparing for randomly occurring accidents and off-normal events is to develop scenarios as a means by which to prioritize and quantify risk and to take action. However, the number of scenarios risk analysts can develop is almost limitless. How do we ascertain which scenario has the greatest merit? One of the more important contributions of probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) has been to quantify the initiating event probability associated with various classes of accidents; and to quantify the occurrence of various conditions, i.e., end-states, as a function of these important accident sequences. Typically, various classes of conditions are represented by scenarios and are quantified in terms of cut sets and binned into end states. For example, the nuclear industry has a well-defined set of initiating events that are studied in assessing risk. The maturation of risk analysis for cyber security from accounting for barriers or looking at conditions statically to one of ascertaining the probability associated with certain events is, in part, dependent upon the adoption of a scenario-based approach. For example, scenarios take into account threats to personnel and public safety; economic damage, and compromises to major operational and safety functions. Scenarios reflect system, equipment, and component configurations as well as key human-system interactions related to event detection, diagnosis, mitigation and restoration of systems1. As part of a cyber attack directed toward control systems, perpetrators will attempt to control and defeat automation systems, engineering access, control systems and protective systems implemented in today's critical infrastructures. Major systems such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are likely targets for attack. Not all attack scenarios have the same expected frequency or consequence. The attacks will be directed and structured and thus, are not be characterized as random events when one considers failure probabilities. Attack types differ in their consequence as a function of the probability associated with various sub events in the presence of specific system configurations. Ideally, a series of generic scenarios can be identified for each of the major critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. A scenario-based approach to risk assessment allows decision makers to place financial and personnel resources in-place for attacks that truly matter: e.g. attacks that generate physical and economic damage. The use of scenario-based analysis allows risk reduction goals to be informed by more than consequence analysis alone. The key CI targets used in the present study were identified previously as part of a mid-level consequence analysis performed at INL by the Control System Security Program (CSSP) for the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This paper discusses the process for and results associated with the development of scenario-based cyber attacks upon control systems including the information and personnel requirements for scenario development. Challenges to scenario development including completeness and uncertainty characterization are discussed as well. Further, the scenario discussed herein, is one of a number of scenarios for infrastructures currently under review.},

abstract={In the era of pervasive usage of information and communication technologies in people everyday life, there is a great impulse in the utilities managing critical infrastructures on the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for monitoring and controlling their technical, service and market processes. Inter and intra connected ICT systems, open ICT architectures and shared communication infrastructures have been adopted for information exchange and maintenance purposes by technologically advanced power utilities. They are also becoming a reality in the future ICT applications supporting the remote control of interconnected power infrastructures composed by bulk and dispersed power generation, and the associated power grids. Any standard for ICT security management requires performing security risk assessment. Efforts for adapting these standards to industrial control systems are ongoing. In the electricity sector, two basic research directions on risk assessment have been undertaken: the definition of a vulnerability and risk assessment procedure specific for cyber security and the development of probabilistic approaches to the risk analysis of electrical contingencies. However the emerging frameworks, while allowing a more in-depth analysis with respect to the deterministic approach based on the N-1 criterion, do not cover the evaluation of both contingencies and automation failures, and a comprehensive risk assessment methodology is far from becoming a state of practice. The paper aims at providing a step forward in the cyber security analysis of electric power control systems, introducing the key aspects of a methodology supporting the security evaluation of power utility information systems, as complex interacting infrastructures involving process knowledge, advanced control and information and communication technologies. The methodology is mainly addressed to security technical managers as an offline analysis tool supporting the power system design and planning phases. It may also be used by the security operators as a support tool for security audits and intrusion monitoring activities during the system operation phase, thus contributing at preventing and counteracting the risk of control system degradation or block. The three basic functions of the methodology are: the correlation of security concepts, the computation of security indexes and the consequent evaluation of security failures. The first function of the methodology is to offer a framework of the relevant security concepts the security manager should examine to carry out a correct security analysis. But above all, the methodology traces step by step a logical route inside these concepts in order to obtain an exhaustive and consistent security profile of the system. So through the methodology, the analyst has a method that makes him able to progressively highlight the relevant security aspects of the system under study; at each step, he will be asked to gather only the information which are strictly necessary to clarify on the system the security aspects the step is referred to.},

abstract={The information society is increasingly dependent on largely distributed systems and infrastructures for life-critical and business-critical functions. The complexity of systems in information society is rapidly growing because of a number of factors like their size, their unboundness, and interdependency, the multiplicity of involved actors, the need to pursue more decentralised control and, last but not least, the growing sophistication in functionality. This trend together with the pervasive use of open information infrastructures for communications as well as of freeware software and common application platforms expose our society to new cyber vulnerabilities and threats that deserve better understanding, assessment, and control. Building trust is essential for the development of the information society, and the electronic commerce in particular. This chapter outlines the main research directions that have been defined as the priority ones in which to engage the European research community in the thematic priority Information Society Technologies (IST) of the 6th Framework Programme.

abstract={A significant challenge for the utilities industry is that the utilities are undergoing a complex transition from state enterprise to public company as to create a competitive market and are moving towards the rising operations and cooperation. Facing power industry market liberalization, utilities must focus on their primary goal that is to provide more competitive electricity for residential, commercial, and industrial customers. As a result, the incremental need-based requirements on IP applications such as SCADA system and administrative work have to be taken into account. While the information systems of power utilities expanded, the risks to them have also shown a corresponding increase. Efforts to allow easier access to information for users bring the possibility of the unsecured network (compromised access to the network). The expansion of corporate IT boundaries as the result of power industry market liberalization complicates security strategies. All of those factors vastly increase the vulnerability of power utility network. A cyber attack that disrupts normal operations could profoundly impact the businesses and municipalities. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) chose to replace traditional Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) - Frame Relay (FR) with Multi-protocol Label Switching MPLS-based services, a network layer (Layer 3) protocol whose routing decisions and reachability information are based upon IP addresses. Therefore, Layer 3 is also the foundation for any service offered by MPLS-based networks. Accordingly, VPN services are also based upon the underlying Layer 3 infrastructure making MPLS-based VPNs networking simple and cost-effective. Rather than setting up and managing individual point-to-point circuits between each office at the substations, operators merely need to provide one connection from their office router to EGAT edge router. The service-provider edge router labels the packets and routes them through its MPLS core to the edge router closest to the destination. With these technologies, EGAT can now offer applications such as VPNs, intranet, and extranet, packet telephony, without the complexity as previously required. As MPLS is becoming a more widespread technology for providing VPN services, MPLS architecture security is increasingly concerned to the backbone network and various applications. This paper focuses on securing communication system and power transmission system of power utilities. The use of operational and administrative applications within the same network provides the benefits of low implementation cost and ease of interoperability, but introduces the potential for electronic security threats and vulnerabilities. To address these in communication network of power utility, lessons learned from communication network assessment activities, design and implementation experience in secure communication systems will be shown. An overview of MPLS architecture security will be reviewed and compared with traditional Layer 2 services from a security perspective. This paper also recommends how to secure an MPLS infrastructure and MPLS/VPN services. In addition, network security policy is proposed to establish guidelines, procedures, prohibitions and requirements to ensure the appropriate protection of MPLS network from abuse and inappropriate use, and to address the need for the privacy and the integrity of data in the network. The enhanced IP/MPLS network of power utilities will be the unified network to support not only the internal needs of the organization including operation and administration applications but also the external requirements that will be another opportunity in telecommunication business in the future.},

abstract={The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 brought to light threats and vulnerabilities that face the United States. In response, the U.S. Government is directing the effort to secure the nation's critical infrastructure by creating programs to implement the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace (1). One part of this effort involves assessing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. These systems are essential to the control of critical elements of our national infrastructure, such as electric power, oil, and gas production and distribution. Since their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States, one of the main objectives of this program is to identify vulnerabilities and encourage the public and private sectors to work together to design secure control systems that resolve these weaknesses. This paper describes vulnerability assessment methodologies used in ongoing research and assessment activities designed to identify and resolve vulnerabilities so as to improve the security of the nation's critical infrastructure.},

abstract={Recent industry workshops have identified the issues of cyber and physical security risks to process control systems (PCS). Characterizing risk for control systems is a blend of all those risks with their effect on operations and the ability to perform the critical functions necessary to continuously provide a product or service. Risk is characterized in terms of threat, vulnerabilities, consequences and impact on business. The goal of a threat assessment is to determine the likelihood of an attack against a given target. Characteristics that can affect a threat's success in an attack include funding, goal intensity, stealth capability, access, cyber skills, implementation time and cyber-organization size. A vulnerability is a weakness that exists in a system, network, application or process that can be exploited by a threat to create an adverse effect. Vulnerability assessments are particularly useful in determining the current state and robustness of an organization's architecture. Consequences can include access and alteration of data, disruption of service, destruction of the system and severe environmental and public health results of an attack. A visible return of investment (ROI) is required for the implementation of security controls to justify the expense of deploying additional security technology such as hardware, software or physical controls.},

Two of the electric industry's commendable and strategic responses to increased cyber threat activity have been the raising of awareness among utilities and the embrace of codified standards.

abstract={Current practices to defend against cyber attacks are typically reactive yet passive. Recent research work has been proposed to proactively predict hacker's target entities in the early stage of the attack. With prediction, there comes false alarms and missed attacks. Very little has been reported on how to evaluate a threat assessment algorithm, especially for cyber security. Because of the variety and the constantly changing nature of hacker behavior and network vulnerabilities, a cyber threat assessment algorithm is, perhaps more susceptible that for other application domains. This work sets forth the issues on evaluating cyber threat assessment algorithms, and discusses the validity of various statistical measures. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the pros and cons of using different metrics under various cyber attack scenarios. Our results show that commonly used false positives and false negatives are necessary but not sufficient to evaluate cyber threat assessment.},

abstract={Cyber attacks are the core of any security assessment of ICT-based systems. One of the more promising research fields in this context is related to the representation of the attack patterns. Several are the models proposed to represent them; these models usually provide a generic representation of attacks. Conversely, the experience shows that attack profiles are strongly dependent upon several boundary conditions. This paper defends that from the security assessment perspective, it is necessary to integrate the knowledge contained in the attack patterns with boundary knowledge related to vulnerability of the target system and to the potential threats. In this paper, after a characterization of this boundary knowledge, we propose an n-dimensional view of the attack tree approach, integrating information on threats and vulnerabilities. Moreover, we show how to use this view to derive knowledge about the security exposure of a target system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 brought to light threats and vulnerabilities that face the United States. In response, the U.S. Government is directing the effort to secure the nation's critical infrastructure by creating programs to implement the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace (1). One part of this effort involves assessing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. These systems are essential to the control of critical elements of our national infrastructure, such as electric power, oil, and gas production and distribution. Since their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States, one of the main objectives of this program is to identify vulnerabilities and encourage the public and private sectors to work together to design secure control systems that resolve these weaknesses. This paper describes vulnerability assessment methodologies used in ongoing research and assessment activities designed to identify and resolve vulnerabilities so as to improve the security of the nation's critical infrastructure.

abstract={Process plants may be subject to terrorist and criminal acts that can cause harm such as the release or diversion of hazardous materials and process or product damage. Such risks are evaluated using threat and vulnerability analysis and possible improvements in security measures and safeguards are identified. However, recommendations for improvements are usually based on engineering judgment. Such subjective assessments can lead to disagreements, and possibly inappropriate measures to reduce risk. Rings of Protection Analysis (ROPA), a simplified risk assessment method, can be used to provide more rational, objective, and reproducible decisions. ROPA parallels Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) that is used to evaluate accident risks. ROPA assists in identifying and determining the adequacy of existing protection systems. It is used to help determine whether there are sufficient rings/layers of protection against a threat scenario and whether the risk can be tolerated. A scenario may require multiple protection rings/layers depending on the process and the potential severity of the consequences. ROPA helps provide the basis for clear, functional specifications of required protection layers. This paper describes and demonstrates how ROPA can be applied to cyber security, although it can also be applied to physical security. It considers the selection of security measures and integrates their consideration with other types of protective measures. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

Following that, an example scenario of what an enterprise can gain by using the TAME methodology instead of an existing risk assessment methodology is given. The reader is not expected to be convinced for the efficiency of the methodology from this simplistic scenario. Its purpose is to "sting" the appetite of the reader towards the effectiveness of the methodology and the extent to which enterprises can get an understanding of the information security threats that they have to face.},

abstract={In the wake of recent events, network security and reliability have become top issues for service providers and enterprises. The worldwide cost of cyber attacks is estimated to have been in the $145 billion dollar range for 2003. 2003 was also regarded as the "worst year ever" for computer viruses and worms; in 2001 the Code Red worm took several days to create widespread damage, whereas Slammer in 2003 had significant impact in just minutes. Over 90% of network attacks resulting in significant financial loss originate from inside a network's perimeter. Unfortunately, there appears to be no end in sight to these threats to network security; in fact, there is an increasing trend of attacking financial resources in addition to computing resources. The newly ratified ITU-T Recommendation X.805 "Security Architecture for Systems Providing End-to-End Communications" was developed as the framework for the architecture and dimensions in achieving end-to-end security of distributed applications. It provides a comprehensive, multi-layered, end-to-end network security framework across eight security dimensions in order to combat network security threats. In this paper, we introduce the X.805 standard and describe how it can be applied to all phases of a network security program. We also provide examples of the business impact of network security vulnerabilities and the application of X.805 for network security assessments. Enterprises and service providers alike should use X.805 to provide a rigorous approach to network security throughout the entire lifecycle of their security programs.},
