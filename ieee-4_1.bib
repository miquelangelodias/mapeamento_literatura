abstract={In this paper, we present a vulnerability assessment framework that could be used to assess and prevent cyber threats related to wired and wireless networks and computer systems. We have performed vulnerability assessment tests for aviation systems including data loaders and in order to meet aviation industry requirements for wireless network security. Our contributions include detecting cyber vulnerabilities in these aviation systems by using vulnerability assessment and penetration testing tools such as Metasploit Pro and BackTrack and improving security and safety of aircraft. Based on our test results of cyber vulnerabilities, the corresponding solutions will be developed to fix these vulnerabilities. New vulnerability assessment tests will be conducted again until our solutions are secure and safe to use. Some results of our vulnerability assessment tests against our software-hardware products are presented.},

abstract={As cyber physical systems are used more extensively and thoroughly, cyber-attacks have become one of the utmost threats to the cybersecurity of cyber physical systems (CPS). It is possible that an adversary can damage a physical component with cyber-attacks (eg. The Stuxnet). Although many research has been done on risk assessment method, limited work has been published to quantify cybersecurity risk of CPS. This paper suggests a method to quantify the cybersecurity risk of CPS caused by cyber-attacks in terms of numeric value. To help quantitatively measure the risk, we present two indices, the successful-attack-probability index and the attack-impact index, based on vulnerability dependency graph. Furthermore, the successful-attack-probability index is calculated considering the interdependent relationship between vulnerabilities and the calculation of attack-impact index takes the impact on the physical domain resulting from cyber-attacks into account. Numerical example shows that the potential risk of system and the optimal attack target can be obtained. The proposed method can be extended to security investment analysis as well.},

abstract={IT system risk assessments are indispensable due to increasing cyber threats within our ever-growing IT systems. Moreover, laws and regulations urge organizations to conduct risk assessments regularly. Even though there exist several risk management frameworks and methodologies, they are in general high level, not defining the risk metrics, risk metrics values and the detailed risk assessment formulas for different risk views. To address this need, we define a novel risk assessment methodology specific to IT systems. Our model is quantitative, both asset and vulnerability centric and defines low and high level risk metrics. High level risk metrics are defined in two general categories; base and attack graph-based. In our paper, we provide a detailed explanation of formulations in each category and make our implemented software publicly available for those who are interested in applying the proposed methodology to their IT systems.},

Many countermeasures have been discussed, developed and deployed, yet the human element remains the least understood and a significant weak link within the system. With this in mind, the social engineer uses a combination of tactics to exploit the vulnerabilities each individual has, to gain access to systems and sensitive information. This paper indicates that not all individuals are susceptible to the same attack, but instead that each of us is likely to succumb to a different type of tactic.

abstract={Cyber-attacks become more and more complex, but the network situation assessment based on log analysis cannot meet the security requirements because of the low quality of logs and alerts. This paper addresses the lack of consideration of security attributes of hosts and attacks in network. What's more, the most common attacks, identity and effectiveness of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) are hard to be proved in risk assessment based on alerts and flow matching. The multi-dimension threat situation assessment method based on network security attributes is proposed in this paper. Firstly, it gives an adaptive Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) calculation, which considers asset value as environment metric. Secondly, it collects deterioration rate of properties by sensors in hosts and network, that aims at assessing the time and level of DDoS attacks. Thirdly, it adopts the distribution of asset value in security attributes considering the features of attacks and network, which aims at assessing and showing the whole situation. Experiments demonstrate that the results show the primary threat and security requirement of network. By comparison and analytic study, the method reflects more in security requirement and security risk situation than traditional methods based on alert and flow analyzing.},

abstract={Cyber threats directly affect the critical reliability and availability of modern Industry Control Systems (ICS) in respects of operations and processes. Where there are a variety of vulnerabilities and cyber threats, it is necessary to effectively evaluate cyber security risks, and control uncertainties of cyber environments, and quantitative evaluation can be helpful. To effectively and timely control the spread and impact produced by attacks on ICS networks, a probabilistic Multi-Attribute Vulnerability Criticality Analysis (MAVCA) model for impact estimation and prioritised remediation is presented. This offer a new approach for combining three major attributes: vulnerability severities influenced by environmental factors, the attack probabilities relative to the vulnerabilities, and functional dependencies attributed to vulnerability host components. A miniature ICS testbed evaluation illustrates the usability of the model for determining the weakest link and setting security priority in the ICS. This work can help create speedy and proactive security response. The metrics derived in this work can serve as sub-metrics inputs to a larger quantitative security metrics taxonomy; and can be integrated into the security risk assessment scheme of a larger distributed system.},

abstract={Medical devices are complex cyber-physical systems incorporating emergent hardware and software components. However, this complexity leads to a wide attack surface posing security risks and vulnerabilities. Mitigation and management of such risks during premarket design and postmarket deployment are required. Dynamically mitigating threat potential in the presence of unknown vulnerabilities requires an adaptive risk-based scheme to assess the system's state, a secure system architecture that can isolate hardware and software components, and design methods that can adaptively adjust the system's topology based on risk changes. The essential complementary aspects during deployment are detecting, characterizing, and quantifying security threats. This article presents a dynamic risk management and mitigation approach based on probabilistic threat estimation. A smart-connected-pacemaker case study illustrates the approach. This article is part of a special issue on Software Safety and Security Risk Mitigation in Cyber-physical Systems.},

abstract={The rapid pace of Electrification in the transportation sector, realized through plug-in electric vehicle (EV) integration, necessitates the smart charging infrastructures. These systems built on real-time data collection and decision making coordinate the charging demand to facilitate high penetration of PEV s in the power grids. Accordingly, the inherent cyber-physical characteristic of smart charging networks makes them susceptible to cyber-physical threats. Due to the lack of a consistent cyber-physical attack assessment in EV networks, this paper aims to propose the vulnerability analysis and risk assessment for the smart charging infrastructures. To this end, we define several potential failure scenarios for the WinSmartEV™ charging system on the UCLA campus and study the impacts of potential cyber-physical attacks. Moreover, we outline a codified methodology and taxonomy for assessing vulnerability and risk of cyber-physical attacks on the EV charging networks in order to create a generalizable and comprehensive solution. The outcome is a framework to prioritize the degree of the vulnerabilities and risks in the EV networks and to develop effective countermeasures.},

abstract={Society is increasingly dependent on the safe and secure operation of a wide range of complex physical-cyber systems. The consequences of failure of these systems can be very serious, particularly where they form part of a nation's critical national infrastructure. There has been a trend to make greater use of commercial-off-the-shelf technology in the design of these systems, which exposes them to software and hardware vulnerabilities found in many consumer and enterprise systems. There is international recognition that a set of twenty critical security controls can provide significant protection for enterprise IT systems. Asset management is required for effective implementation of seven of these controls. This paper examines how an asset management can contribute to physical-cyber security. The use of asset management systems to support cyber security is novel. It requires additional information to be held regarding the nature, configuration and vulnerabilities of the hardware and software assets and thus supports situational awareness and threat assessment for new vulnerabilities.},

abstract={Securing high value and critical assets is one of the biggest challenges facing this nation and others around the world. In modern integrated systems, there are four potential modes of attack available to an adversary: 1 physical only attack, 2 cyber only attack, 3 physical-enabled cyber attack, 4 cyber-enabled physical attack. Blended attacks involve an adversary working in one domain to reduce system effectiveness in another domain. This enables the attacker to penetrate further into the overall layered defenses. Existing vulnerability assessment (VA) processes and software tools which predict facility vulnerabilities typically evaluate the physical and cyber domains separately. Vulnerabilities which result from the integration of cyber-physical control systems are not well characterized and are often overlooked by existing assessment approaches. In this paper, we modified modification of the timely detection methodology, used for decades in physical security VAs, to include cyber components. The Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool (PACRAT) prototype illustrates an integrated vulnerability assessment that includes cyber-physical interdependencies. Information about facility layout, network topology, and emplaced safeguards is used to evaluate how well suited a facility is to detect, delay, and respond to attacks, to identify the pathways most vulnerable to attack, and to evaluate how often safeguards are compromised for a given threat or adversary type. We have tested the PACRAT prototype on critical infrastructure facilities and the results are promising. Future work includes extending the model to prescribe the recommended security improvements via an automated cost-benefit analysis.},

abstract={In recent years, cloud computing has emerged as a key computing paradigm because of its ubiquitous, convenient and scalable on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources. Although the use of the cloud has many advantages, a great number of security threats exist affecting assets that are present in a cloud environment. In order to mitigate these threats, frameworks have been developed to asses the security of an organisation, based on analysing risks to critical assets. However, these frameworks are not yet sufficiently developed to specifically address risks in cloud environments. In this paper, we advocate the use of game theory to improve the security assessment of cloud environments, in particular the risk analysis step in OCTAVE. We extend previous game-theoretic models for security risk assessment within cloud environments by designing cost and benefit functions that are to a large extent informed by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).},

abstract={Decentralized Critical infrastructure management systems will play a key role in reducing costs and improving the quality of service of industrial processes, such as electricity production. The recent malwares (e.g. Stuxnet) revealed several vulnerabilities in today's Distributed Control Systems (DCS), but most importantly they highlighted the lack of an efficient scientific approach to conduct experiments that measure the impact of cyber threats on both the physical and the cyber parts of Networked Critical Infrastructures (NCIs). The study of those complex systems, either physical or cyber, could be carried out by experimenting with real systems, software simulators or emulators. Experimentation with production systems suffers from the inability to control the experiment environment. On the other hand the development of a dedicated experimentation infrastructure with real components is often economically prohibitive and disruptive experiments on top of it could be a risk to safety. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of a Cyber-Physical (CP) testbed which includes physical equipment. We illustrate and the cyber security issues on the communication channel between the Critical Infrastructures(CIs), such as a power grid, a nuclear plant and the energy market. We simulate the power grid network (including nuclear plant), but we emulate the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) part which is the focus of our work. Within this context we assume that we are able to implement scenarios, which produce consequences on the normal operation of the power power grid and the financial area.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates how the Insider Threat Cybersecurity Framework (ITCF) web tool and methodology help provide a more dynamic, defense-in-depth security posture against insider cyber and cyber-physical threats. ITCF includes over 30 cybersecurity best practices to help organizations identify, protect, detect, respond and recover to sophisticated insider threats and vulnerabilities. The paper tests the efficacy of this approach and helps validate and verify ITCF's capabilities and features through various insider attacks use-cases. Two case-studies were explored to determine how organizations can leverage ITCF to increase their overall security posture against insider attacks. The paper also highlights how ITCF facilitates implementation of the goals outlined in two Presidential Executive Orders to improve the security of classified information and help owners and operators secure critical infrastructure. In realization of these goals, ITCF: provides an easy to use rapid assessment tool to perform an insider threat self-assessment; determines the current insider threat cybersecurity posture; defines investment-based goals to achieve a target state; connects the cybersecurity posture with business processes, functions, and continuity; and finally, helps develop plans to answer critical organizational cybersecurity questions. In this paper, the webtool and its core capabilities are tested by performing an extensive comparative assessment over two different high-profile insider threat incidents.},

However, this dependence of automation, control and communication technologies makes railway systems becoming increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks and security threats which affects the overall performance. This paper deals with cybersecurity concerns facing these systems. As such, we analyse characteristics of railway threat landscape. Then, we discuss the direct impacts of the identified potential threats and their consequences on the whole system and we evaluate resulted risks. For space limitation, we choose to present the impact, likelihood and risk analysis for one functionality of the system, namely External Door control (EDC). Some good practices and related techniques for the development of safer, more comfortable, and more secure future railway systems are also discussed.},

abstract={The security of the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly recognized as a major concern. IoT technology has matured in recent years; however, the same cannot be said for the security of these devices. Despite their efficacy, IoT devices are not secure and are open to vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. The challenge here is to secure the data that IoT devices hold from the external objects or an attack within its network that can hinder the development and put the data at risk. The objective of this research is to investigate the architecture of various IoT systems and to use them to identify the common key components that need to be assessed to minimize the security gap in IoT systems. Based on the current literature a framework is proposed to assess the known vulnerabilities of IoT systems. Currently, there is no standard framework that can be used to assess the security of IoT devices, due to varied constraint in the interconnection of these devices. This research focuses on outlining the vulnerabilities that exist in IoT devices and how these can be assessed using the security assessment framework. It lays the foundation on how this framework evaluates each vulnerability of an IoT System and what can be done to reduce these existing vulnerabilities. The proposed framework provides accurate and realistic assessment outcomes by considering the threats and avoiding the involvement of external factors that can put the assessment process at risk. This framework is designed to combine with other frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27000, COBIT 5, ANSI/ISA 62443, and NIST SP 800-53.},

Some institutions believe this results in an increase in service and productivity, while reducing the cost of physical wiring; as users bring their devices such as laptops and tablets. With embracing the benefits of Wi-Fi, potential cyber threats can arise through this usage.

Since WBAN developed for medical devices, the system should be design for a wide range of end user with different professional skill groups. This require WBAN system to be open, accurate and efficient. As from our previous experienced, any open system is vulnerable, similar to any other current available wireless systems such as Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). However, currently there were not many discussions on the WBAN security vulnerability and security threats and if there is any, the issues were discussed through theoretical, concept and simulation data.

abstract={Recent advancements in wireless communication are creating a spectrum shortage problem on a daily basis. Recently, Cognitive Radio (CR) has attempted to minimize this problem by allowing secondary users to coexist with primary users without causing interference to their communication through dynamic utilization of free spectrum. CR offers many promising benefits including dynamic spectrum sharing, robust cross-layer adaptation, and collaborative networking. It is anticipated that CR technology will be the next wave of innovation in information and communications technologies. Although operational aspects of CR are being explored vigorously, its security aspects have gained little attention. Due to the dynamic nature of CR networks and the fact that they exposed relatively more to wireless networks, entirely new classes of security threats and challenges are introduced, such as licensed user emulation, selfish misbehaviors and unauthorized use of spectrum bands. To achieve successful deployment of CR technologies in practice, there is a critical need to advance the theoretical understanding of these entirely new classes of security threats and challenges. Therefore, in this paper, our primary objective is to identify and investigate the major known security threats within a CR network (CRN). Our secondary objective is to highlight on how potential threats exploit the vulnerabilities present at different layers of a communication stack.},

abstract={The Department of the Defense has transitioned smart devices into the battlefield as a portable hand-held unmanned aerial vehicle ground control station without adequate cyber security protections, putting critical mission data at risk to cyber security attacks. Industry has developed software apps for smart phones and tablets that allows soldiers to not only pilot unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but to share and receive intelligence and reconnaissance videos and images remotely from the ground control station (GCS) or directly from the UAV. The Department of Defense has not developed a secure communication network that will support a large quantity of smart devices, nor certification, standards or policies for operation of secure smart devices. Therefore, mission critical information will be shared through unsecured, mobile and wireless networks and through unclassified, unsecure smart technology that are vulnerable to cyber security risks. Lack of security of the mobile and wireless networks and smart devices could result in the unintentional sharing of data as well as loss of control of the UAV to enemies. The Department of Defense has failed to develop a threat model and risk assessment to identify the cyber security threats and ensure the proper security countermeasures are in place. This paper will analyze the cyber security vulnerabilities within the communication links, smart devices hardware, specifically smart phones and tablets, and software applications to develop a risk model of the threat profile of the GCS networking hub. This model will help designers and users of the military and civilian UAV communities to understand the threat profile of the GCS networking hub to develop a secure communication network based upon the vulnerabilities identified for smart phones and tablets.},

An important intention of targeted attacks by nation states may be the degradation of cyber physical systems of their enemies. After these developments, cyber-attacks have become an agenda item of the academics, practitioners and policy makers. In this study, we employed Monte-Carlo reliability analysis technique to quantify the impact of cyber-attacks on industrial control systems used in power generation systems.

abstract={One of the most important components constructing the information security management system is the risk assessment process. Information technology system risks have a direct impact on the mission of organisations. Risk assessment allows organisations to identify weaknesses and security threats, and adopt appropriate solutions to deal with risks. The risk identification and assessment is the most important and complex part of the risk management process. In this study, a method has been presented to asset technical risks with regard to the sensitivity of each of the assets. In this research, the cyber battlefield framework has been presented to analyse the assets' sensitivity and then to determine the risk of each. The cyber battlefield contains exact information about cyber environment, including a vulnerability of knowledge repository, tangible and intangible components of cyber environment, and the relationships between them. Cyber-attacks are performed using vulnerabilities in the cyber environment components, so the present study focuses on the provision of a method to determine the risk due to the vulnerabilities. Considering the cost of risks treatment, the risks have been prioritised.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a system of system which integrates physical system with cyber capability in order to improve the physical performance. It is being widely used in areas closely related to national economy and people's livelihood, therefore CPS security problems have drawn a global attention and an appropriate risk assessment for CPS is in urgent need. Existing risk assessment for CPS always focuses on the reliability assessment, using Probability Risk Assessment (PRA). In this way, the assessment of physical part and cyber part is isolated as PRA is difficult to quantify the risks from the cyber world. Methodologies should be developed to assess the both parts as a whole system, considering this integrated system has a high coupling between the physical layer and cyber layer. In this paper, a risk assessment idea for CPS with the use of attack tree is proposed. Firstly, it presents a detailed description about the threat and vulnerability attributes of each leaf in an attack tree and tells how to assign value to its threat and vulnerability vector. Then this paper focuses on calculating the threat and vulnerability vector of an attack path with the use of the leaf vector values. Finally, damage is taken into account and an idea to calculate the risk value of the whole attack path is given.},

abstract={An organisation's security posture is an indication the countermeasures that have been implemented to protect the organisations resources. The countermeasures are security best practice that are appropriate to the organisations risk appetite and the business requirements. The security posture is defined by an organisations security policy and its mission statement and business objectives. Countermeasures come with a cost which should not exceed the value of the resources they are protecting and they should be effective, provide value for money, and a return on investment for the organisation Measuring how the organisations actual security posture relates to its agreed acceptable level of risk is a problem that is faced by organisations when looking at whether their countermeasures are effective and providing value for money and a return on investment. There are two methodologies that can be used. 1. Auditing - which is the mechanism of confirming that the processes or procedures agree to a master checklist for compliance 2. Assessing - is a more active, or intrusive, testing methodology to adequately assess your processes or procedures that cannot be adequately verified using a checklist or security policy This paper investigates the surface attack area of an organisations infrastructure and applications examining the cases where the use of cloud and mobile computing have extend the infrastructure beyond the traditional perimeter of organisations physical locations and the challenges this causes in assessing the security posture. A review of the use of assessment methodologies such as vulnerability assessment and penetration testing to assess the infrastructure and application security posture of an organisation shows how they can provide identification of vulnerabilities which can aid the risk assessment process in developing a security policy. It will demonstrate how these methodologies can help in assessing the effectiveness of the implemented countermeasures and aid in evaluation as to whether there are provide value for money and a return on investment. It is proposed that a long term strategy of using both methodologies for assessing the security posture based on the business requirements will provide the following benefits. : Cost effective monitoring of the infrastructure and security posture. : Ensuring that the countermeasures retain effectiveness over time. : Responding to the continual changing threat environment. : Ensuring that value for money and return on investment are maintained.},

abstract={The number and type of threats to modern information and communication networks has increased massively in the recent years. Furthermore, the system complexity and interconnectedness has reached a level which makes it impossible to adequately protect networked systems with standard security solutions. There are simply too many unknown vulnerabilities, potential configuration mistakes and therefore enlarged attack surfaces and channels. A promising approach to better secure today's networked systems is information sharing about threats, vulnerabilities and indicators of compromise across organizations; and, in case something went wrong, to report incidents to national cyber security centers. These measures enable early warning systems, support risk management processes, and increase the overall situational awareness of organizations. Several cyber security directives around the world, such as the EU Network and Information Security Directive and the equivalent NIST Framework, demand specifically national cyber security centers and policies for organizations to report on incidents. However, effective tools to support the operation of such centers are rare. Typically, existing tools have been developed with the single organization as customer in mind. These tools are often not appropriate either for the large amounts of data or for the application use case at all. In this paper, we therefore introduce a novel incident clustering model and a system architecture along with a prototype implementation to establish situational awareness about the security of participating organizations. This is a vital prerequisite to plan further actions towards securing national infrastructure assets.},

abstract={The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) enabled a new class of smart and interactive devices. With their continuous connectivity and their access to valuable information in both the digital and physical world, they are attractive targets for security attackers. Hence, with their integration into both the industry and consumer devices, they added a new surface for cybersecurity attacks. These potential threats call for special care of security vulnerabilities during the design of IoT devices and CPS. The design of secure systems is a complex task, especially if they must adhere to other constraints, such as performance, power consumption, and others. A range of design space exploration tools have been proposed in academics, which aim to support system designers in their task of finding the optimal selection of hardware components and task mappings. Said tools offer a limited way of modeling attack scenarios as constraints for a system under design. The framework proposed in this paper aims at closing this gap, offering system designers a way to consider security attacks and security risks during the early design phase. It offers designers to model security constraints from the view of potential attackers, assessing the probability of successful security attacks and security risk. The framework's feasibility and performance is demonstrated by revisiting a potential system design of an industry partner.},

However, this opens healthcare organisations' systems to external elements used within or beyond their premises, new risks and vulnerabilities in what regards cyber threats and incidents. We propose the creation of a Security Assessment as a Service (SAaaS) crosslayered system that is able to identify vulnerabilities and proactively assess and mitigate threats in an IT healthcare ecosystem exposed to external devices and interfaces, considering that most users are not experts (even technologically illiterate") in cyber security and, thus, unaware of security tactics or policies whatsoever. The SAaaS can be integrated in an IT healthcare environment allowing the monitoring of existing and new devices, the limitation of connectivity and privileges to new devices, assess a device's cybersecurity risk and - based on the device's behaviour - the assignment and revoking of privileges. The SAaaS brings a controlled cyber aware environment that assures security, confidentiality and trust, even in the presence of non-trusted devices and environments.},

abstract={In smart power systems, information and communication technologies are being broadly installed and two-way communications are being established more effectively and efficiently. However, they are vulnerable to cyber-physical interactive threats and their impact depends on the system infrastructure, degree of interaction, degree of vulnerability, and the intensity and the frequency of the attack. The study addresses this problem and proposes: (i) an innovative Markov-chain based framework of the cyber-intrusion process to implement operating conditions in a smart power system; (ii) an advanced algorithm for power system reliability assessment, incorporating cyber-intrusion process and a detailed model of a heat pump system; and (iii) a new impact assessment framework for different cyber-intrusion detection-time distributions driven by Monte Carlo simulation. The cyber-detection and system recovery process with the presence of cyber-physical interactive operation models suggest that a significant level of impacts could be generated by the interactive operation of the smart power system and a quantitative assessment is needed in order to assess true impacts.},

abstract={Information security continues to evolve in response to disruptive changes with a persistent focus on information-centric controls and a healthy debate about balancing endpoint and network protection, with the goal of improved enterprise and business risk management. Economic uncertainty, intensively collaborative work styles, virtualization, increased outsourcing and ongoing compliance pressures require careful consideration and adaptation of a balanced approach. The cyberspace security econometrics system (CSES) provides a measure of reliability, security and safety of a system that accounts for the criticality of each requirement as a function of one or more stakeholderspsila interests in that requirement. For a given stakeholder, CSES reflects the variance that may exist among the stakes one attaches to meeting each requirement. This paper summarizes the basis, objectives and capabilities for the CSES including inputs/outputs as well as the structural underpinnings.},

abstract={One purpose of the Department of Energy (DOE) Infrastructure Assurance Outreach Program (IAOP) is to assist energy infrastructure providers in assuring the continued delivery of their critical services. One means of doing this has been the conduct of a number of vulnerability assessments for energy infrastructure providers. The assessments differ from those that are provided by other organizations in process, focus, scope and access to expertise. An assessment approach leveraged from other assessment methodologies has been developed that is unique. The focus is vulnerabilities of critical control systems in the context of a broader enterprise security assessment. Additionally, both physical and cyber security are evaluated, along with an analysis of threat, impact and overall risk characterization. The assessment also includes a risk assessment element to provide a framework for prioritizing recommendations generated from the other assessment elements. The DOE objective is to enable the energy infrastructure provider to enhance its security posture, with the understanding that these organizations are stewards of infrastructures with significant national importance. The sensitivity of the information gathered necessitates special provisions to address a key concern of industry: nondisclosure to external parties and the government. This is addressed through IAOP policies and through legally binding nondisclosure agreements with the participating national laboratories involved with the assessment. These security assessments are intended to augment the highly successful efforts by energy infrastructure providers to ensure reliability of service from traditional threats such as equipment failure, severe weather, or human error. However, changes in technology (primarily information technology), changes in business models (including that driven by deregulation), and the emergence of new external threats (ranging from hackers to state agencies and international competitors) suggest that industry may need to adopt new approaches to assuring delivery of energy services. It is toward this end that the assessments have been conducted.},

Its aim, to provide agile information technology solutions and infrastructure is the primary reason for its popularity. It enables the organizations to ensure that their resources are utilized efficiently, development process is enhanced and investments or costs incurred to buy technological resources are reduced. At the same time Cloud computing is being scrutinized in the security world due to the various vulnerabilities and threats that it poses to the user data or resources. This paper highlights the vulnerabilities that exist in applications available on the cloud and aims to make an analysis of different types of security holes found in these applications by using open source vulnerability assessment tools. It identifies the security requirements pertinent to these applications and makes an assessment whether these requirements were met by them by testing two of these applications using the vulnerability tools. It also provides remedial measures for the security holes found in these applications and enables the user to select a secure provider for themselves while at the same time enabling the cloud provider to improve their services and find a competitive edge in the market.},

abstract={The developing complexity of cyberspace has provoked the need for increased security methods in order to protect users and their information. Information available online including a user's banking information, social media, and etc., makes individual users more susceptible to potential attacks. The risk is exponentially larger when you look at an enterprise or larger scale networks, as; a network's security is only as strong as its weakest link and incidents small scale incidents such as an undetected virus on your computer can compromise you and your information. It takes more than a firewall to protect a computer from malicious actors; a full end to end cybersecurity system should be used instead. Many organizations have already acknowledged this risk and have established practical Enterprise Security systems that consist of multi-part security measures. These measures include complex scanners and orchestrators that can fully protect a user and their information, as well as detect and prevent any threats that it may encounter, this includes; Endpoint Management Systems, Network Scanners, and SIEMs (Security Information and Event Managers). These components are responsible for quickly detecting and denying entry into a computer, or into a network from an unknown user. However, they must work in conjunction with all security measures and hardware in an enterprise system, as alone they cannot reach their full potential. Therefore, a layered security approach of multiple components is recommended to combat potential threats, rather than a simple firewall. Network Scanner's for instance, are tasked with conducting vulnerability scans, and network port scans on a computer network which aids in conducting security assessments and system maintenance. Endpoint Management Systems, like firewalls, are tasked with conducting a three-step process that verifies the integrity of IP devices before allowing them to connect to a network. This greatly reduces any potential threat of being hacked or having information stolen by an exterior actor, due to unfamiliar and suspicious users being denied access. Finally, SIEM systems act as the administrator for the entire network by consolidating logs for actions taken inside the network either by end users or by the defensive cybersecurity tools. This situational awareness gives SIEM the capability to alert other components of a network in order to conjoin and suspend network access or to suspend a computer's current action. In comparison to only a firewall, which only provides a single point of security, these components work in conjunction in order to secure all information and assets inside and outside of a network, while firewalls simply attempt to block any potential threats from gaining access, and do not when an adversary has already penetrated into a network. All in all, it is important to consider the multiple layers of security needed to fully protect a user and their sensitive information, seeing as firewalls lack the capabilities that a full-fledged enterprise system has to protect users. In the poster, we will carefully look at how exactly each component in a security enterprise plays a role in defending users.},

In this environment, the smart grid will inevitably be exposed to a wide range of new security threats, e.g. cyber-attacks. This paper begins by introducing some basic concepts from complex network theory. Next, error and attack tolerance methodology based analysis models are reviewed in detail. The smart grid framework is then formed as a cyber-physical system, in essence modeled as an interdependent complex network. Finally some suggestions are made for future vulnerability analyses of the smart grid.},

abstract={Cyber-attacks and intrusions in cyber-physical control systems are, currently, difficult to reliably prevent. Knowing a system's vulnerabilities and implementing static mitigations is not enough, since threats are advancing faster than the pace at which static cyber solutions can counteract. Accordingly, the practice of cybersecurity needs to ensure that intrusion and compromise do not result in system or environment damage or loss. In a previous paper [2], we described the Cyberspace Security Econometrics System (CSES), which is a stakeholder-aware and economics-based risk assessment method for cybersecurity. CSES allows an analyst to assess a system in terms of estimated loss resulting from security breakdowns. In this paper, we describe two new related contributions: 1) We map the Cyberspace Security Econometrics System (CSES) method to the evaluation and mitigation steps described by the NIST Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, Special Publication 800-82r2. Hence, presenting an economics-based and stakeholder-aware risk evaluation method for the implementation of the NIST-SP-800-82 guide; and 2) We describe the application of this tailored method through the use of a fictitious example of a critical infrastructure system of an electric and gas utility.},

Every now and then cases of Hacking and Exploitation are being observed. So in order to remain immune and minimize such threats, the Organizations conduct regular Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on their Technical Assets [1]. We at IDRBT have developed a new automated VAPT Testing Tool named Net-Nirikshak 1.0 which will help the Organizations to assess their Application/Services and analyze their Security Posture. Net-Nirikshak 1.0 detects the vulnerabilities based on the applications and Services being used on the target system. Apart from these it detects the SQL Injection vulnerabilities and reports all the Identified vulnerable links on the Target. Further the tool can also exploit the identified SQLI vulnerable links and grab confidential information from Target.The automated VAPT report generated by the tool is sent to the specified Email and all the traces of Scan along with the Report are removed from the Hard disk so as to ensure the Confidentiality of the VAPT Report. All the Technical and Operational aspects of Net-Nirikshak 1.0 are described in this paper along with the Outputs of a sample VAPT Test conducted on www.webscantest.com using Net-Nirikshak 1.0.},

abstract={Emerging trends that are shaping the future of the automotive industry include electrification, autonomous driving, sharing, and connectivity, and these trends keep changing annually. Thus, the automotive industry is shifting from mechanical devices to electronic control devices, and is not moving to Internet of Things devices connected to 5G networks. Owing to the convergence of automobile-information and communication technology (ICT), the safety and convenience features of automobiles have improved significantly. However, cyberattacks that occur in the existing ICT environment and can occur in the upcoming 5G network are being replicated in the automobile environment. In a hyper-connected society where 5G networks are commercially available, automotive security is extremely important, as vehicles become the center of vehicle to everything (V2X) communication connected to everything around them. Designing, developing, and deploying information security techniques for vehicles require a systematic security-risk-assessment and management process throughout the vehicle's lifecycle. To do this, a security risk analysis (SRA) must be performed, which requires an analysis of cyber threats on automotive vehicles. In this study, we introduce a cyber kill chain-based cyberattack analysis method to create a formal vulnerability-analysis system. We can also analyze car-hacking studies that were conducted on real cars to identify the characteristics of the attack stages of existing car-hacking techniques and propose the minimum but essential measures for defense. Finally, we propose an automotive common-vulnerabilities-and-exposure system to manage and share evolving vehicle-related cyberattacks, threats, and vulnerabilities.},

abstract={Insufficient authentication and authorization of interconnected components are major risks in the Industrial Control System (ICS). To address this, we introduce CyRA, a realtime risk-based security assessment framework that consists of a Nested-ICS security architecture, secure registration protocol, and risk-based multi-factor authentication protocol by which every component is authenticated and authorized to ensure secure communications and prevent cyber attacks in the ICS. Our proposed framework applies Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (ZKPK) to perform risk-based multi-factor authentication and authorization using a digitally signed identity that encodes secrets provided by the component. Our approach is based on Threat Modeling (TM), Vulnerability Identification (VI), and Consequence Analysis (CA) to provide adequate and efficient authentication and authorization in the ICS. The resilience of our framework is evaluated against recent well-known cyber attacks. Specifically, we conduct a risk-based security assessment for a Safety Instrumentation System (SIS) communication protocol, known as TriStation. The results show that our framework enhances the security of the protocol in dealing with real-time uncertainty of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences from a new cyber-attack, known as TRITON malware.},

In the context of cyber security, social engineering is the practice of taking advantage of human weaknesses through manipulation to accomplish a malicious goal. This literature review identifies various social engineering cyber security threats in diverse environments. Exploiting humans as the weakest security link in such environments, as opposed to technical vulnerabilities and system protocols, has led to increased calls for raising information security awareness among users. One of the most straightforward solutions is through effective training and education programs. As such, the paper details how innovative information security education programs can effectively increase user/employee awareness and ultimately reduce cyber security incidents.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are vulnerable to network attacks because communication relies on the network that links the various components in the CPS. The importance of network security is self-evident. In this study, we conduct a network security risk assessment from the perspectives of the host and the network, and we propose a new framework for a multidimensional network security risk assessment that includes two stages, i.e., risk identification and risk calculation. For the risk identification stage, we propose a multidimensional hierarchical index system for assessing cybersecurity risk; the system's security status is determined in three dimensions, i.e., basic operation, vulnerabilities, and threats, and these dimensions guide the data collection. In the risk calculation stage, we use a hidden Markov model (HMM) to assess the network security risk. We provide a new definition of the quality of alert and optimize the observation sequence of the HMM. The model uses a learning algorithm instead of setting the parameters manually. We introduce the concept of network node association to increase the reliability and accuracy of the risk assessment. The simulation results show that the proposed index system provides quantitative data that reflect the security status of the network. The proposed network security risk assessment method based on the improved HMM (I-HMM) reflects the security risk status in a timely and intuitive manner and detects the degree of risk that different hosts pose to the network.},

abstract={Incident reporting is a component of safety management systems across many industries. Their perceived success has led to the development of similar approaches in cyber security; information about previous attacks can be used to identify wider vulnerabilities and to inform future threat assessments. However, it can be difficult to integrate safety and security reporting within a single system. For example, in safety reporting systems the aim is often to disseminate lessons as widely as possible. In cyber security, there is a concern that this might motivate and inform further attacks. This paper identifies the challenges that arise in developing reporting schemes for security incidents in safety-critical applications. In particular we focus on the problems of implementing intrusion detection systems and coordinating forensic analysis without undermining system safety. These problems are exacerbated because existing cyber-security reporting guidelines focus more on office based systems than complex, command and control applications.},

Cyber security assessment was conducted on ICS (Industrial control systems) of different companies for a period of four years and several vulnerabilities were identified. Main problems included use of weak encryption, standard protocols and information disclosure using unencrypted communication among ICS hosts on the network. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, a hacker could alter the communication between ICS and controlled equipment, resulting in malfunction. Overcoming these vulnerabilities is essential in order to protect the vital power sector in any country of the world. We present important guidelines and standards in cyber security and propose a simple intrusion detection scheme for SCADA networks.},

abstract={A prioritized cyber defense remediation plan is critical for effective risk management in cyber-physical systems (CPS). The increased integration of Information Technology (IT)/Operational Technology (OT) in CPS has to lead to the need to identify the critical assets which, when affected, will impact resilience and safety. In this work, we propose a methodology for prioritized cyber risk remediation plan that balances operational resilience and economic loss (safety impacts) in CPS. We present a platform for modeling and analysis of the effect of cyber threats and random system faults on the safety of CPS that could lead to catastrophic damages. We propose to develop a data-driven attack graph and fault graph-based model to characterize the exploitability and impact of threats in CPS. We develop an operational impact assessment to quantify the damages. Finally, we propose the development of a strategic response decision capability that proposes optimal mitigation actions and policies that balances the trade-off between operational resilience (Tactical Risk) and Strategic Risk.},

abstract={The vulnerability of cloud computing systems (CCSs) to advanced persistent threats (APTs) is a significant concern to government and industry. We present a cloud architecture reference model that incorporates a wide range of security controls and best practices, and a cloud security assessment model-Cloud-Trust-that estimates high level security metrics to quantify the degree of confidentiality and integrity offered by a CCS or cloud service provider (CSP). Cloud-Trust is used to assess the security level of four multi-tenant IaaS cloud architectures equipped with alternative cloud security controls. Results show the probability of CCS penetration (high value data compromise) is high if a minimal set of security controls are implemented. CCS penetration probability drops substantially if a cloud defense in depth security architecture is adopted that protects virtual machine (VM) images at rest, strengthens CSP and cloud tenant system administrator access controls, and which employs other network security controls to minimize cloud network surveillance and discovery of live VMs.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining momentum as billions of devices and wirelessly connected systems will soon be adopting various IoT technologies and exchanging potentially sensitive information. IoT devices can be deployed and linked to cloud services using local Wi-Fi and cellular Internet connections via IPv6. However, as a distributed environment for an open market and a rich source of "big data" with unlimited systems interactions, the IoT would allow attackers to identify many vulnerable targets and to launch their attacks. Such vulnerabilities and attacks could have an impact on any number of services and systems within and across different critical infrastructures. The major problem is that the existing IoT mechanisms and protocols have not been designed to deal with such challenges. Therefore, the security of the IoT has come into question which means that, in order to be secure, the IoT will require robust and secure objects, protocols and systems. Recent advances in the fields of IoT such as embedded systems security, industrial malware analysis, detection and prevention are a key factor in the growth of IoT services and operations. This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on wireless technologies and on the role of IoT in the healthcare sector in particular. IoT systems and their users are vulnerable to a range of security threats and malicious activities. Therefore, rigorous research is required to develop security approaches and technologies that are capable of responding to this new evolving environment. This paper presents different risks and security threats to the IoT, some security measures and solution models as well as a vulnerability assessment approach for the IoT in the healthcare sector.},

abstract={Recent malware, like Stuxnet and Flame, constitute a major threat to networked critical infrastructures (NCIs), e.g., power plants. They revealed several vulnerabilities in today's NCIs, but most importantly they highlighted the lack of an efficient scientific approach to conduct experiments that measure the impact of cyber threats on both the physical and the cyber parts of NCIs. In this paper, we present EPIC, a novel cyber-physical testbed, and a modern scientific instrument that can provide accurate assessments of the effects that cyber-attacks may have on the cyber and physical dimensions of NCIs. To meet the complexity of today's NCIs, EPIC employs an Emulab-based testbed to recreate the cyber part of NCIs and multiple software simulators for the physical part. Its main advantage is that it can support very accurate, real-time, repeatable, and realistic experiments with heterogeneous infrastructures. We show through several case studies how EPIC can be applied to explore the impact that cyber-attacks and Information and Communications Technology system disruptions have on critical infrastructures.},

FUZZBUSTER uses a suite of fuzz testing and vulnerability assessment tools to find or verify the existence of vulnerabilities.

abstract={With the developing cyber physical power systems and emerging threat of cyber-attacks, the traditional power services are faced with higher risks of being compromised, as vulnerabilities in cyber infrastructure can be exploited to cause physical damage. Therefore, adjustments need to be made in current control scheme design methods to mitigate the impact of potential attacks on service quality. In this paper, focusing on the service of coordinated source-load participation in primary frequency regulation, a vulnerability analysis is performed with modelling the attack intrusion process, and the risk assessment of the service is made by further modelling the attack impacts on the service's physical effects. On that basis, the traditional coordinated reserve allocation optimization model is modified and the allocation scheme is corrected according to the cyber-attack impacts. The proposed correction methods are validated through a case study, showing effectiveness in defending against the cyber-attack impacts.},

abstract={Threats of cyber attacks are very real today and greatly impact everything including the public health sector, economics, electric grids, internet of things (IoT), and national security. The number of new evolving threats and reported vulnerabilities has severely increased in the last few years [1]. Perpetually refined cyber-attacks have set data, organizational assets, organizations, and individuals at considerable risk. Protecting sophisticated networks and interdependent systems, or reducing the impact of cyber-attacks has become a major challenge, where today's effective countermeasures can be completely ineffective tomorrow. The various risk assessment frameworks and methodologies are either high-level, missing risk metrics values, not suitable for all kinds of networks, or publicly not available. To address this issue, we present a quantitative risk assessment model, that helps to model the organizational security posture, evaluates the security controls in place, and provides an understanding of the associated risks. We further provide a detailed explanation of the formulations and evaluate the proposed model on an industrial scenario.},

abstract={Integrated Modular Communication (IMC) is an on-board platform to provide secure and reliable aircraft communications for a diverse set of applications. IMC is viewed as an important part of the future Air Traffic Management (ATM) infrastructure. Integrating communication links and combining diverse applications in a single platform (IMC) do come with some risks to the ATM communications that could potentially increase vulnerabilities and make the system more prone to security attacks. There are several types of attacks on network communications such as disrupting or blocking communication, intercepting, injecting fabricated packets, accessing and modifying the information. In this study, the Security Risk Assessment Methodology (SecRAM) is applied to IMC for identifying runtime threats, assessing the risks involved, and defining measures to mitigate them. The risk assessment is performed to evaluate the impact and likelihood of occurrence of attacks relevant to the identified threats and the resulting risk levels. Consequently, specific mitigation measures as IMC's security controls are proposed to provide cyber resiliency for the IMC. The IMC security controls will be validated in an emulated testbed environment in the GAMMA project.},

abstract={In Today's age of growing connectivity, anything and everything remains connected. This makes Security, one of the prime concerns of every Information System in Cyber Space. Hence, Information Security Management is something that Organizations cannot afford to compromise. In this evolving era of Offensive technologies, the practice of Cyber Defence has become much more complicated and the need for Security Auditing techniques has gradually increased. In order to preserve their corporate image and protect their valuable information, the Organizations must conduct periodic Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT). VAPT being a proactive Security Auditing technique can efficiently help an Organization to defend its Information systems from various Cyber threats. This paper describes how VAPT tools can be used to identify the Vulnerabilities in the current Security Arrangements and avoid possible Cyber-attacks. The paper also talks about the VAPT Models which provide a Blueprint to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the Complete Auditing Process. The paper enlists a set of best fit Open-Source/Free VAPT tools for every aspect of testing, which can be easily accessed and used by the Organizations to audit their security arrangements as a part of the Proactive Cyber Defence Strategy.},

abstract={Power grid information security and protection has aspects of both Industrial Control Systems (ICS) as well as Information Technology (IT) Systems. Although both ICS and IT systems require information security services to combat malicious attacks, the specifics of how these services are used for the power grid depend upon appropriate risk assessment and risk control. Distinct types of attacks targeting ICS and IT systems as well as different performance requirements of these systems determine a specific priority order of the security services implemented for each system. Threat profiles of the power transmission and distribution management functions, where availability is paramount to all other security services, differ significantly from threat profiles of IT functions such as utility customer billing where confidentiality is a greater concern hence warranting different security posturing. This paper discusses different approaches for security risk management in the context of the smart power grid. Methodologies proposed for risk assessment include threat and vulnerability modeling schemes which help in identifying and categorizing the threats, as well as in analyzing their impacts, and subsequently prioritizing them. Risk management planning techniques as they apply to both ICS and IT systems are also discussed.},

abstract={This paper presents a work in progress simulation and a novel model for estimating the impact of cyber attacks. Previous methods so far, have taken the old - fashioned "intuition" approach - a qualitative or quantitative risk based analysis on the business level. More recent technical approaches involve simulations on networks of systems and sensor input from 3rd party detection tools of events occurring into the network. We propose an interdependency impact assessment approach, focusing on the responsibilities and the dependencies that flow through the supply chain, mapping them down into an agent - based socio - technical model. This method should be especially useful for modeling consequences across all levels of complex organizations networks - business processes, business roles and systems. We are aiming to make forward and backward inferences on threat scenarios and perform impact assessment, providing situational awareness and vulnerability analysis for cyber defense purposes.},

abstract={Information security practitioners face a challenging task of assessing the information security risks. The lack of complete information about the vulnerabilities in the system leads to the problem of information asymmetry between the security stakeholders. This leads to difficulty in assessing the severity of vulnerabilities and estimation of the impact of an attack. There are at least two approaches to deal with information asymmetry in the information security market, namely market methods and financial instruments. This paper focuses on a relatively novel method: prediction markets, to deal with the information asymmetry problem in information security domain. In this paper, we examine the applicability of prediction markets in forecasting and assessment of information security events. We describe the usefulness of prediction markets in prediction of vulnerabilities, setting values for vulnerabilities and threats, and as a source of aggregating security information for pricing of cyber-financial instruments, such as cyber-insurance.},

abstract={Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the process of using tools and information to passively learn enough information about an organization to begin the cyber attack cycle. OSINT gathering is often the first step in a malicious cyber campaign. Social Media and the Internet (e.g., search engines, open source tools, blogs) are quickly becoming invaluable sources of information for malicious cyber actors. These two very popular forms of technology are notorious for inherently accumulating and archiving personal information about people, organizations, and networks. These technologies also give information perpetual life, which can be summoned at any time by those in possession of the right knowledge (i.e., Data Science) and tools to extract this information. We posit that the extent of these privacy violations have increased to the point where OSINT identified vulnerabilities may be as useful to attackers as zero-day vulnerabilities, since organizations are likely just as unaware of their presence. We refer to the tools and techniques used to identify these types of vulnerabilities as privacy violating OSINT (PV-OSINT). In this paper, we bring to light the very serious damage that can be done to critical infrastructure (CI), by the use of PV-OSINT. We tested our methodology with a real CI, we then shared our findings with the CI owner to verify the efficacy of our approach. Then we developed a framework that could be used by CI owners to constantly assess the security of their networks using PV-OSINT.},

Yet Bangladesh government's and developers' reluctance to address the severity of the attacks resulted in Bangladesh Bank heist. In this paper, we aim to study and conduct an investigation of the vulnerabilities of similar attacks as these of the Bangladesh Bank heist on web applications of Bangladesh. We would focus on XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities due to their high ranking on the OWASP list. We analyze the data collected during the investigation and provide a summary of the current state and a guideline for the future web developers.},

abstract={In cloud computing, security risks posed to individual clients are different based on their specific security requirements. In current practice, cloud providers usually apply generic protection mechanisms that may not be effective in addressing specific threats for different clients. In this paper, we describe a tool, called ‘ThreatRiskEvaluator’ that assesses security risks that are specific and relevant to specific cloud clients. The tool implements a novel risk analysis mechanism that utilizes various security-related properties of the cloud such as vulnerability information, the probability of an attack, as well as client-specific security requirements. The method enables cloud providers to make fine-grained decisions for selecting specific protection mechanisms to tackle specific risks posed to individual clients based on their security needs against specific threats.},

abstract={Power grids are often run near the operational limits because of increasing electricity demand, where even small disturbances could possibly trigger major blackouts. The attacks are the potential threats to trigger large-scale cascading failures in the power grid. In particular, the attacks mean to make substations/transmission lines lose functionality by either physical sabotages or cyber attacks. Previously, the attacks were investigated from substation-only/transmission-line-only perspectives, assuming attacks can occur only on substations/transmission lines. In this paper, we introduce the joint substation-transmission line perspective, which assumes attacks can happen on substations, transmission lines, or both. The introduced perspective is a nature extension to substation-only and transmission-line-only perspectives. Such extension leads to discovering many joint substation-transmission line vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the joint substation-transmission line attack strategies. In particular, we design a new metric, the component interdependency graph (CIG), and propose the CIG-based attack strategy. In simulations, we adopt IEEE 30 bus system, IEEE 118 bus system, and Bay Area power grid as test benchmarks, and use the extended degree-based and load attack strategies as comparison schemes. Simulation results show the CIG-based attack strategy has stronger attack performance.},

The incident of a civilian UAV disrupting a major airport, is one example of many incidents raising questions on the future of airspace security. While a civilian hobbyist might be ignorant of the impending harm, the situation could pose a threat to the air operations. Using this incident and others like it, ideas on the future trends in cyber awareness applied to avionics are considered. Three general ideas are incorporated: (1) mandates for new rules for airspace restrictions (e.g., geofence), (2) advanced display analytics to support the airport staff and pilots with visual displays, such as collision avoidance, and (3) electronics to support the mitigation of electronic cyber effects posed by the obtrusive aircraft. With a variety of opinions posed, the summary is intended to foster a discussion on research, industry, and commercial directions for the avionics community to consider with respect to cyber awareness.},

As a result of developing technologies and policy that make autonomy a feasible solution, at least three separate organizations are aiming to produce and sail their first autonomous ships by 2020. Thus it is essential to begin assessing their cyber-risk profiles in order to rank and mitigate any vulnerabilities. As existing risk models for physical ship safety and autonomous cars do not adequately represent the unique nature of cyber-threats for autonomous vessels within the maritime sector, this article applies a model-based risk assessment framework named MaCRA which had previous only been used to model existing ships, not those of the near-future.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of the number of connected devices on the internet, a significant increase in internet and network applications in the last decade led to the appearance of function-based networks called the Internet of Things (IoT). Such interest and dependency come with exponentially increasing security threats. Those threats are very dynamic, and change continuously despite the fact that IoT devices may not go through the same speed for security fixes, updates, etc. As a result, research trends focus on utilizing data analytics to build intelligence and autonomous mechanisms to enable IoT systems to respond to threats in real time. To this end, our project goal is to evaluate methods to build fast and efficient intrusion detection systems (IDS) that meet the high scalability and dynamicity of IoT environments.In this research, we studied three different datasets used to represent IoT network traffic and used them as a benchmark to evaluate many IDSs' performances. Results showed that features' quality has an impact on classification models and thus IDS performance. Our results showed also that the optimum time-window of an IDS preferred to be long (decay factor 0.01 or 0.1) when evaluating the BotNet_IoT dataset.},

abstract={Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are emerging as a current research discipline at the convergence of physical, biological, engineering and data sciences. As technology evolves, Cyber Physical Systems become vulnerable to a wider spectrum of threats. Addressing these threats require the need for novel solutions for protecting critical infrastructure. However, there are two distinct challenges faced by researchers from cross-disciplinary fields such as energy systems, data science, and cyber security. First, there are lack of experimental platforms integrating industry-standard hardware, software and protocols. This impedes the research of conducting cybersecurity study on CPS including vulnerabilities connected with CPS parts and modeling their corresponding impact. Second, the absence of systematic labelled data along with other information relevant to the model poses hazards to the growth and assessment of data mining algorithms that can classify CPS cyber threats. Therefore, an experimental platform is required to model attacks and understand their impact on system operations and endusers and further develop analytics based security solutions to mitigate them. In this paper, we develop a cyber physical testbed using NS-3 network simulator in conjunction with Raspberry Pi acting as a proxy for CPS hardware components. In addition, we model a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), a potential cyber threat in CPS using NS-3. Finally, we develop an anomaly detection system using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that uses network layer parameters to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviour. Evaluation shows that our proposed system achieves an accuracy of 98.32%.},

abstract={Modern power systems heavily rely on the associated cyber network, and cyber attacks against the control network may cause undesired consequences such as load shedding, equipment damage, and so forth. The behaviors of the attackers can be random, thus it is crucial to develop novel methods to evaluate the adequacy of the power system under probabilistic cyber attacks. In this study, the external and internal cyber structures of the substation are introduced, and possible attack paths against the breakers are analyzed. The attack resources and vulnerability factors of the cyber network are discussed considering their impacts on the success probability of a cyber attack. A procedure integrating the reliability of physical components and the impact of cyber attacks against breakers are proposed considering the behaviors of the physical devices and attackers. Simulations are conducted based on the IEEE RTS79 system. The impact of the attack resources and attack attempt numbers are analyzed for attackers from different threats groups. It is concluded that implementing effective cyber security measures is crucial to the cyber-physical power grids.},

abstract={Internet-connected devices will represent an increasing proportion of the load served by electric power systems. As these devices could conceivably be hijacked and controlled remotely by a malicious actor, they could represent a new threat vector against the dynamic security of a power system. Such attack strategies have not been considered in the existing literature on power system cybersecurity. As an initial scoping exercise, the present case study explores whether such devices could be remotely hijacked and then maliciously power-cycled at particular frequencies to deliberately provoke harmful oscillations in an electrical grid. To gauge the broad feasibility of this novel style of attack, dynamic simulations are performed on two representative test power systems, at differing levels of attacker and defender resources. These simulations show that power-cycling just 1% of consumer loads at a system's resonant frequency may sometimes provoke harmful electromechanical oscillations throughout a national grid. This novel simulation exercise, therefore, implies that cybersecurity vulnerabilities at the consumer side could jeopardise the physical integrity of a nation's entire electricity supply.},

abstract={Health data is important as it provides an individual with knowledge of the factors needed to be improved for oneself. The development of fitness trackers and their associated software aid consumers to understand the manner in which they may improve their physical wellness. These devices are capable of collecting health data for a consumer such sleeping patterns, heart rate readings or the number of steps taken by an individual. Although, this information is very beneficial to guide a consumer to a better healthier state, it has been identified that they have privacy and security concerns. Privacy and Security are of great concern for fitness trackers and their associated applications as protecting health data is of critical importance. This is so, as health data is one of the highly sort after information by cyber criminals. Fitness trackers and their associated applications have been identified to contain privacy and security concerns that places the health data of consumers at risk to intruders. As the study of Consumer Health continues to grow it is vital to understand the elements that are needed to better protect the health information of a consumer. This research paper therefore provides a conceptual threat assessment framework that can be used to identify the elements needed to better secure Consumer Health Wearables. These elements consist of six core elements from the CIA triad and Microsoft STRIDE framework. Fourteen vulnerabilities were further discovered that were classified within these six core elements. Through this, better guidance can be achieved to improve the privacy and security of Consumer Health Wearables.},

This cyber security strategy will examine both domain-specific and common requirement to ensure interoperability of solution across different part of infrastructure. This strategy will require risk management framework developed by both private and public sector. This framework will establish the processes for combining impact, vulnerability, and threat information to produce an assessment of risk to the distributed energy delivery system. The approach of this risk management will consider an organizational perspective, cyber security requirement, standard security system, and electricity security guideline and protection plan. This risk management will be applied on an asset, system, and network basis, as applicable. Some security architecture such as key management, virtualization security within cloud computing, and smart privacy will be linked to the energy delivery system. The final strategy of this effort will be a set of recommended cyber security requirements that will be allocated to interfaces of the Smart Grid. The goal is to ensure that a comprehensive assessment of the systems and component of the distributed energy delivery system is completed.},

In this paper, we present a vulnerability assessment and a coordinated detection method to improve the cyber-physical security of electric vehicles with four motor drives, which is one of the emerging power electronics applications. As the lateral stability control system (LSCS) is designed through the yaw moment generated by the torque deviation between distributed motors, cyber-threats to motor drives will cause vehicle instability and hence life-threatening consequences. In response to this issue, we propose a set of innovative index-based metrics to evaluate the performance degradation due to cyber-physical attacks on the LSCS and motor drives. Evaluation results, including both transient and statistic results, are provided for a variety of threat scenarios. To further improve the cyber-physical security of the EV, we propose a coordinated detection methodology that combines state observer and the proposed evaluation metrics. The simulation results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed detection method.},

abstract={The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a widely adopted standard robotic middleware. However, its preliminary design is devoid of any network security features. Military grade unmanned systems must be guarded against network threats. ROS 2 is built upon the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard and is designed to provide solutions to identified ROS 1 security vulnerabilities by incorporating authentication, encryption, and process profile features, which rely on public key infrastructure. The Department of Defense is looking to use ROS 2 for its military-centric robotics platform. This paper seeks to demonstrate that ROS 2 and its DDS security architecture can serve as a functional platform for use in military grade unmanned systems, particularly in unmanned Naval aerial swarms. In this paper, we focus on the viability of ROS 2 to safeguard communications between swarms and a ground control station (GCS). We test ROS 2's ability to mitigate and withstand certain cyber threats, specifically that of rogue nodes injecting unauthorized data and accessing services that will disable parts of the UAV swarm. We use the Gazebo robotics simulator to target individual UAVs to ascertain the effectiveness of our attack vectors under specific conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROS 2 in mitigating the chosen attack vectors but observed a measurable operational delay within our simulations.},

abstract={A significant challenge in modern computer security is the growing skill gap as intruder capabilities increase, making it necessary to begin automating elements of penetration testing so analysts can contend with the growing number of cyber threats. In this paper, we attempt to assist human analysts by automating a single host penetration attack. To do so, a smart agent performs different attack sequences to find vulnerabilities in a target system. As it does so, it accumulates knowledge, learns new attack sequences and improves its own internal penetration testing logic. As a result, this agent (AgentPen for simplicity) is able to successfully penetrate hosts it has never interacted with before. A computer security administrator using this tool would receive a comprehensive, automated sequence of actions leading to a security breach, highlighting potential vulnerabilities, and reducing the amount of menial tasks a typical penetration tester would need to execute. To achieve autonomy, we apply an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, Q-learning, with an approximator that incorporates a deep neural network architecture. The security audit itself is modelled as a Markov Decision Process in order to test a number of decision-making strategies and compare their convergence to optimality. A series of experimental results is presented to show how this approach can be effectively used to automate penetration testing using a scalable, i.e. not exhaustive, and adaptive approach.},

On the methodological side a risk metric has been defined assigning a value to the cyber/power risk in relation to the occurrence rate of cyber contingencies and their impact on the power service. The higher criticality threats have been experimented in the RSE Laboratory by simulating selected attack processes on telecontrol test beds of passive interconnected HV/MV distribution grids. The experiments concern cyber threats to ICT network components, such as routers and SCADA systems, having a critical role in power grid operation. The experiments assessed the residual vulnerabilities of protected IEC 60870-5-104 TCP/IP based communications between Control Centres and Substation Automation Systems in presence of attack processes assuming different degrees of knowledge about the attacked system's behaviour. The evaluation framework supporting the experimental activity allows monitoring the communication status through a set of measurements such as Inter Message Time, Number of Lost Messages, Inter Reconnection Time and Time To Failure. The knowledge and measures from controlled experiments are then exploited by the cyber-risk metrics to improve the estimation of the vulnerability and threat probabilities related to the successfulness of a given attack.},

abstract={Modern critical infrastructure systems are built on a hodgepodge of complex, interconnected information systems for control and management. For electric power, the critical infrastructure includes the physical systems; comprised of power generation, transmission and distribution capabilities. The control of the physical systems is accomplished via Supervisory Command and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The SCADA systems employ both new and legacy systems along with many of the same information system devices as traditional business information systems. SCADA system networks, just as business information system networks, are connected to external networks, including the Internet. Thus, SCADA systems are vulnerable to the same classes of threats as other networked computer systems in addition to threats associated with their legacy systems. Many of these systems have been put in place for decades and often have an unknown security posture. Cyber security analysis of these systems remains a significant challenge. Traditional techniques such as red-teaming, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing are often unsatisfactory and limited in scope because power utilities do not want to risk taking the systems off-line or degrading or damaging the expensive equipment. The consequence is that the effects of a cyber-attack on these SCADA systems are often unknown. In order to provide greater SCADA system security posture insight to utilities and administrators, security experts must perform security analysis. To overcome the problems with security analysis using either an exclusive hardware SCADA testbed or a simulation of a SCADA system, Sandia National Labs has developed a cyber-security analysis capability using physical hardware, extensive virtualization and emulated machines, and simulation to answer complex system questions about SCADA systems. In this paper we will discuss the methodology, several use-cases that were executed during the course of the study which leverage the methodology, the types of cyber-attacks that can be assessed and the class of questions security professionals can now ask and answer about cyber-attacks against SCADA systems.},

abstract={Current practices to defend against cyber attacks are typically reactive yet passive. Recent research work has been proposed to proactively predict hacker's target entities in the early stage of the attack. With prediction, there comes false alarms and missed attacks. Very little has been reported on how to evaluate a threat assessment algorithm, especially for cyber security. Because of the variety and the constantly changing nature of hacker behavior and network vulnerabilities, a cyber threat assessment algorithm is, perhaps more susceptible that for other application domains. This work sets forth the issues on evaluating cyber threat assessment algorithms, and discusses the validity of various statistical measures. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the pros and cons of using different metrics under various cyber attack scenarios. Our results show that commonly used false positives and false negatives are necessary but not sufficient to evaluate cyber threat assessment},

Despite the numerous benefits of interconnecting ICS components, the wide adoption of Information Technologies (IT) has introduced new security challenges and vulnerabilities to industrial processes, previously obscured by the systems' custom designs. Towards securing the backbone of critical infrastructure, selection of the proper assessment environment for performing cyber-security assessments is crucial. In this paper, we present a layered analysis of vulnerabilities and threats in ICS components, that identifies the need for including real hardware components in the assessment environment. Moreover, we advocate the suitability of Hardware-In-The-Loop testbeds for ICS cyber-security assessment and present their advantages over other assessment environments.},

Before wide-scale deployment in civil aviation, any airborne or ground-based technology must be ensured to have no adverse impact on safe and profitable system operations, both under normal conditions and failures. With ADS-B, there is a lack of a clear understanding about vulnerabilities, how they can impact airworthiness and what failure conditions they can potentially induce. The proposed work streamlines a threat assessment methodology for security evaluation of ADS-B based surveillance. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to identify the need for mechanisms to secure ADS-B based airborne surveillance and propose a security solution.

abstract={The maritime sector is critical in terms of economic activities and commercial impact not only for the European society but more importantly for the Mediterranean EU Member States, especially under the current economic turmoil. Commercial ports are the main gateways and face increased requirements, responsibilities and needs in view of a secure and sustainable maritime digital environment. Therefore, they have to rely on complicated and advanced facilities, ICT infrastructure and trustworthy e-maritime services in order to optimize their operations. This paper aims at alleviating this gap on the basis of a holistic approach that addresses the security of the dual nature of ports' Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs). In particular, it introduces a collaborative security management system (CYSM system), which enables ports' operators to: (a) model physical and cyber assets and interdependencies; (b) analyse and manage internal / external / interdependent physical and cyber threats / vulnerabilities; and (c) evaluate / manage physical and cyber risks against the requirements specified in the ISPS Code and ISO27001.},

abstract={Developers have to ensure that their systems meet certain security requirements. Structured argumentation can be a powerful tool for developers to deal with system behavior, vulnerabilities, and threats. Haley's framework is based on construction of a context for the system, representing security requirements as constraints, and developing satisfaction arguments for the security requirements. Incomplete and uncertain information and limited resources force the developers to settle for good-enough security. Risk assessment in Security Argumentation (RISA) extends Haley's method with risk assessment. RISA uses publicly available catalogs of security expertise and most common attack patterns to support risk assessment. These catalogs provide valuable information to the assessment process and help the developers identify mitigations for security requirements satisfaction. RISA developers stated the most pressing issue of their future work is the validation of RISA. In previous studies, no validation of RISA framework has been done on a complex system. Hence, this work evaluates RISA framework by applying it to the security requirements analysis of the address generation module of the decentralized, peer-to-peer communication protocol Bit Message. In addition, based on this analysis, we suggest a new set of requirements to improve the security of the current Bit Message client version.},

abstract={With the increasing growth of cyber-attack incidences, it is important to develop innovative and effective techniques to assess and defend networked systems against cyber attacks. One of the well-known techniques for this is performing penetration testing which is carried by a group of security professionals (i.e, red team). Penetration testing is also known to be effective to find existing and new vulnerabilities, however, the quality of security assessment can be depending on the quality of the red team members and their time and devotion to the penetration testing. In this paper, we propose a novel automation framework for cyber-attacks generation named `HARMer' to address the challenges with respect to manual attack execution by the red team. Our novel proposed framework, design, and implementation is based on a scalable graphical security model called Hierarchical Attack Representation Model (HARM). (1) We propose the requirements and the key phases for the automation framework. (2) We propose security metrics-based attack planning strategies along with their algorithms. (3) We conduct experiments in a real enterprise network and Amazon Web Services. The results show how the different phases of the framework interact to model the attackers' operations. This framework will allow security administrators to automatically assess the impact of various threats and attacks in an automated manner.},

abstract={Organizations rely on security experts to improve the security of their systems. These professionals use background knowledge and experience to align known threats and vulnerabilities before selecting mitigation options. The substantial depth of expertise in any one area (e.g., databases, networks, operating systems) precludes the possibility that an expert would have complete knowledge about all threats and vulnerabilities. To begin addressing this problem of fragmented knowledge, we investigate the challenge of developing a security requirements rule base that mimics multi-human expert reasoning to enable new decision-support systems. In this paper, we show how to collect relevant information from cyber security experts to enable the generation of: (1) interval type-2 fuzzy sets that capture intra- and inter-expert uncertainty around vulnerability levels; and (2) fuzzy logic rules driving the decision-making process within the requirements analysis. The proposed method relies on comparative ratings of security requirements in the context of concrete vignettes, providing a novel, interdisciplinary approach to knowledge generation for fuzzy logic systems. The paper presents an initial evaluation of the proposed approach through 52 scenarios with 13 experts to compare their assessments to those of the fuzzy logic decision support system. The results show that the system provides reliable assessments to the security analysts, in particular, generating more conservative assessments in 19% of the test scenarios compared to the experts' ratings.},

abstract={The crisis of insecure software has resulted in a drastic increase in the frequency and impact of cyber attacks on businesses and individual users alike. The discipline of secure software engineering has evolved as a response to this trend, with the aim of producing software with fewer coding bugs or design flaws that result in exploitable vulnerabilities. However, secure software engineering is a young discipline, and many software artifacts in current use were created before, or in ignorance of, its development. Software practitioners would benefit greatly from a rigorous methodology for analyzing and validating software that has already entered its maintenance lifecycle. In this paper, we present a combined penetrating testing methodology that incorporates strengths of several existing approaches, with the goal to understand their utility and benefit for analyzing security of existing software programs. We exercise this methodology through a case study applied to a popular tool used by many network security practitioners: Wireshark. As a contribution, our study illustrates the benefits of a combined approach and outlines recommendations for a holistic method that will improve security-based risk assessment. Specifically, we show how application of rigorous test-driven threat modeling can produce better abuse cases, which can in turn be used to inform and more precisely define penetration testing activities.},

abstract={Current trends indicate that IT security measures will need to greatly expand to counter the ever increasingly sophisticated, well-funded and/or economically motivated threat space. Traditional risk management approaches provide an effective method for guiding courses of action for assessment, and mitigation investments. However, such approaches no matter how popular demand very detailed knowledge about the IT security domain and the enterprise/cyber architectural context. Typically, the critical nature and/or high stakes require careful consideration and adaptation of a balanced approach that provides reliable and consistent methods for rating vulnerabilities. As reported in earlier works, the Cyberspace Security Econometrics System provides a comprehensive measure of reliability, security and safety of a system that accounts for the criticality of each requirement as a function of one or more stakeholders' interests in that requirement. This paper advocates a dependability measure that acknowledges the aggregate structure of complex system specifications, and accounts for variations by stakeholder, by specification components, and by verification and validation impact.},

However, the addition of PMUs opens the system to cyber threats that might, in fact, lower system reliability. The analysis in this work looks at the effect of these threats on the overall system reliability of a real system layout based on real PMU data obtained from a utility.

abstract={Cellular networks play an increasing role supporting critical government, including military and private information systems. Enhanced capability and ubiquity of mobile devices (i.e., smartphones) is resulting in increasing cyber exploit developments targeting the smartphone and growing concern of exploits targeting the cellular infrastructure. Telecommunication advances such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) continue to move cellular communications to an all IP core. An all IP core is part of the move to Next Generation Network (NGN). However, the transition to NGN is expected to occur over time, and during the lengthy transition period multiple generations of telecommunication must coexist and interoperate. Legacy telecommunication equipment such as 3G cellular communications and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) must interoperate with modern telecommunication equipment such as 4G/LTE and IMS. Cellular telecommunications provide IP connectivity to external networks including the Internet. Thus, both legacy and NGN cellular telecommunications are vulnerable to the same classes of threats as other networked computer systems connected to the Internet, in addition to threats associated with their legacy systems. Cyber security analysis of these systems remains a significant challenge. Traditional techniques such as red-teaming, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing are often unsatisfactory and limited in scope because of the lack of access to telecommunication infrastructure equipment. The consequence is that the effects of a cyber-attack on cellular telecommunications are often unknown.In order to provide greater cellular telecommunications security posture and insight to system providers, equipment manufacturers, and researchers, security analysis of these systems must occur. Performing experiments on telecommunication systems or on a telecommunication testbed is a key part of security analysis. To overcome the problems with security analysis using expensive telecommunication hardware, Sandia National Laboratories has developed a cellular telecommunication cyber-security analysis testbed using physical hardware, extensive virtualization and emulated machines, and simulation to answer complex system questions about cellular systems and their interaction with legacy and NGN fixed systems. In this paper we will discuss the testbed development and components, several use-cases that were executed during the course of the study which leverage the testbed, the types of cyber-attacks that can be assessed, and the class of questions security analysts can now ask and answer about cyber-attacks against cellular systems. In the use-cases we used the testbed to assess the system-level impacts when published component-level vulnerabilities are exploited by a red team.},

abstract={This paper presents a methodology for assessing the vulnerability of power and energy systems and components to weapons effects, accidental explosions, and attacks by terrorists, saboteurs, and vandals. The functioning of these systems depends on such devices and equipment as fuel tanks, pumps, transformers, control panels, insulators, wiring and piping, and generators. Damage mechanisms for components such as these and the means to determine their occurrence for specific components and threats are described herein. The damage mechanisms considered include those associated with airblast, shock, cratering, ballistic impact, penetration, and fire threats, although the methodology could be extended to include a broader spectrum of threats including cyber, electromagnetic, hostile vehicle etc. To facilitate assessment of the sorts of infrastructure elements that are used by power generation and energy transmission utilities, a damage function for individual components is introduced. For example, the damage function can provide a means to estimate the level of damage incurred by various equipment as a function of their distance from the point of detonation, and the size and type of the explosive used. This function may be incorporated as part of an assessment code, or it may also be used as a standalone means to estimate damage for a specific utility component, such as described in [2].},
