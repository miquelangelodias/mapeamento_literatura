abstract={Cybersecurity data remains a challenge for the machine learning community as the high volume of traffic makes it difficult to properly disambiguate anomalous from normal behaviour. That decision is the core of an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a component responsible for raising alerts whenever a potential threat is detected. However, with high volume data in contemporary systems, these IDSs generate numerous alerts, too large for human operators to exhaustively investigate. Moreover, simply reporting a single possible threat is often not sufficient, since the security analyst has to investigate the alert without any further clues of the underlying cause. In order to combat these issues, we empirically compare popular deep neural learning architectures for the problem of intrusion detection in sequential data streams. Contrary to a majority of research studies, we do not take a classification-based approach that requires labeled examples of hostile attacks. Instead, we adopt an unsupervised anomaly detection approach that aims to model a benign sequential data distribution against which new test instances are compared to. We also examine one additional deep network in the form of an attention model capable of providing explanations in addition to its predictions; such information is of crucial importance to network operators since it provides additional guidance to resolve potential threats. For our experiments, we evaluate the models against a variety of data sets of different complexities, ranging from simple unidimensional (synthetic and Yahoo!) to more complex multi-source (CICIDS2017 and small real-world enterprise network) data streams. In order to facilitate end-user needs, we focus on ranking-based metrics for comparing different deep neural architectures. This evaluation is especially important for security analysts to prioritize their anomaly investigations. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that a variant of a recurrent neural network generally outperforms a popular non-sequential deep autoencoder commonly used for unsupervised anomaly detection. The attentional model did not provide sufficiently good performance and explanations that we discuss in our analysis. Nonetheless, given that the global financial outlays for cybersecurity are calculated in trillions of dollars, our evaluation and identification of the top-performing RNN architectures for anomaly detection in sequential data streams can lead to improved intelligent IDS design, while our contributions of attentional explanation will hopefully lay the foundations for future improvements to the explanatory capability of these intelligent learning-based IDSs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Vocal signals mediate social relationships, and among networks of territorial animals, information is often shared via broadcast vocalizations. Anthropogenic noise may disrupt communication among individuals within networks, as animals change the way they vocalize in noise. Furthermore, constraints on signal transmission, including frequency masking and distance, may affect information exchange following a disruption in social networks. We tested the hypothesis that signaling interactions within networks of breeding male and female house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) depend on distance, ambient noise, and receiver nesting stage. We used playback experiments to simulate territorial intrusions with and without noise playbacks on the territories of established males and simultaneously recorded the vocal responses of neighbors. To examine whether intrusions impacted interactions between males, we used randomization tests to determine whether treatment, distance, noise, or nesting stage affected vocal coordination between challenged and neighboring males. We also quantified singing patterns to explore whether intrusions on territories of challenged males affected singing by males and females on neighboring territories. Males sang at the lowest rates and were less likely to overlap songs with the challenged male when their partner was laying, compared to males during early and late nesting stages. Noise and distance did not affect vocal coordination or male singing rates. Fewer females sang during the intruder-only treatment compared to the control and intrusions with noise. Added noise in the territories of challenged males may have masked signals, and as a result, females only changed their behavior during the intruder-only treatment. Our results suggest that the fertility of breeding partners may be more important to males than short-term changes on rival male territories. Elevated noise did little to alter male responses to threats within networks. Females appeared to eavesdrop on interactions involving neighboring males, but noise may have prevented detection of their interactions. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={Potential of intrusion during smart meter data collection is an important problem for household privacy in next-generation smart homes. There are various privacy protection methods such as hiding the real usage with renewable batteries (RBs) and encrypted communication. There are privacy threats due to the detection of the energy transfer through RBs while encryption-based methods result in high computational complexity. In this study, a novel privacy improvement mechanism is proposed based on the routing of energy through multiple smart meters among multiple houses in a neighborhood. The optimization of privacy based on uniform randomization is theoretically modeled and some heuristic solutions are presented. In this method, energy transfer is randomly distributed among multiple smart meters, real usage of a house is buffered with the RB and smart meter indices are randomly selected. In numerical simulations, privacy improvement is shown by utilizing the random selection of smart meter indices for randomizing the energy routing and the buffers of RBs. Furthermore, energy privacy (EP) metric validating the simulation results is defined. Energy routing with multiple smart meters provides a practical and low complexity privacy protection mechanism for next-generation smart grid architectures. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Network data collection is a vital part in the process of network monitoring, traffic billing, network management and intrusion detection. As a new kind of network architecture, Software Defined Network (SDN) provides a possibility of intelligent and adaptive network data collection with centralized control and programming. However, existing literatures lack a concrete solution to economically collect network data, while satisfying the quality of data processing and analytics. Current data collection methods are not sufficiently adaptive and intelligent in terms of network context awareness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive network data collection system in SDN by automatically selecting proper data collection nodes based on network status in a dynamic way. During data collection, network traffic is sampled by considering flow characteristics in order to effectively reduce the amount of collected data while ensuring the accuracy of later data analysis, e.g., malicious traffic detection. A series of experiments are conducted to test and verify the data collection system and show its advantages through comparison with existing works in terms of CPU/memory consumption, storage usage, flow size recovery, and threat perception. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber security has recently received enormous attention in today's security concerns, due to the popularity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the tremendous growth of computer networks, and the huge number of relevant applications. Thus, detecting various cyber-attacks or anomalies in a network and building an effective intrusion detection system that performs an essential role in today's security is becoming more important. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning techniques, can be used for building such a data-driven intelligent intrusion detection system. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection Tree ("IntruDTree") machine-learning-based security model that first takes into account the ranking of security features according to their importance and then build a tree-based generalized intrusion detection model based on the selected important features. This model is not only effective in terms of prediction accuracy for unseen test cases but also minimizes the computational complexity of the model by reducing the feature dimensions. Finally, the effectiveness of our IntruDTree model was examined by conducting experiments on cybersecurity datasets and computing the precision, recall, fscore, accuracy, and ROC values to evaluate. We also compare the outcome results of IntruDTree model with several traditional popular machine learning methods such as the naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor, to analyze the effectiveness of the resulting security model. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Presently, we are living in a hyper-connected world where millions of heterogeneous devices are continuously sharing information in different application contexts for wellness, improving communications, digital businesses, etc. However, the bigger the number of devices and connections are, the higher the risk of security threats in this scenario. To counteract against malicious behaviours and preserve essential security services, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are the most widely used defence line in communications networks. Nevertheless, there is no standard methodology to evaluate and fairly compare NIDSs. Most of the proposals elude mentioning crucial steps regarding NIDSs validation that make their comparison hard or even impossible. This work firstly includes a comprehensive study of recent NIDSs based on machine learning approaches, concluding that almost all of them do not accomplish with what authors of this paper consider mandatory steps for a reliable comparison and evaluation of NIDSs. Secondly, a structured methodology is proposed and assessed on the UGR'16 dataset to test its suitability for addressing network attack detection problems. The guideline and steps recommended will definitively help the research community to fairly assess NIDSs, although the definitive framework is not a trivial task and, therefore, some extra effort should still be made to improve its understandability and usability further. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Background: Dengue is an emerging vector disease with frequent outbreaks in Nepal that pose a major threat to public health. Dengue control activities are mostly outbreak driven, and still lack systematic interventions while most people have poor health-related knowledge and practices. Mobile Short Message Service (SMS) represents a low-cost health promotion intervention that can enhance the dengue prevention knowledge and practices of the affected communities. This study aimed to explore the acceptability, appropriateness, and effectiveness of mobile SMS intervention in improving dengue control practices. Methods: This study was an implementation research that used mixed-methods design with intervention. A total of 300 households were divided into three groups, i.e. one control group, one dengue prevention leaflet (DPL) only intervention group and one DPL with mobile SMS intervention group (DPL + SMS). We used a structured questionnaire to collect information regarding participants' knowledge and practice of dengue prevention. We conducted in-depth interviews with key informants to measure acceptability and appropriateness of intervention. Mean difference with standard deviation (SD), one-way ANOVA, paired t-test and regression analyses were used to assess the effectiveness of the interventions. Thematic analysis was used to assess the acceptability, and appropriateness as well as barriers and enablers of the intervention. Results: The DPL + SMS intervention produced significantly higher mean knowledge difference (32.7 ± 13.7 SD vs. 13.3 ± 8.8 SD) and mean practice difference (27.9 ± 11.4 SD vs 4.9 ± 5.4 SD) compared to the DPL only group (p = 0.000). Multivariate analysis showed that the DPL + SMS intervention was effective to increase knowledge by 28.6 points and practice by 28.1 points compared to the control group. The intervention was perceived as acceptable and appropriate by the study participants and key stakeholders. Perceived barriers included reaching private network users and poor network in geographically remote areas, while enabling factors included mobile phone penetration, low cost, and shared responsibility. Conclusions: Mobile SMS is an effective, acceptable and appropriate health intervention to improve dengue prevention practices in communities. This intervention can be adopted as a promising tool for health education against dengue and other diseases. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Cloud computing has evolved as a new paradigm for management of an infrastructure and gained ample consideration in both industrial and academic area of research. A hidden Markov model (HMM) combined with Markov games can give a solution that may act as a countermeasure for many cyber security threats and malicious intrusions in a network or in a cloud. A HMM can be trained by using training sequences that may be obtained by analyzing the file traces of packet analyzer like Wireshark network analyzer. In this article, the authors have proposed a model in which HMM can be build using a set of training examples that are obtained by using a network analyzer (i.e., Wireshark). As it is not an intrusion detection system, the obtained file traces may be used as training examples to test a HMM model. It also predicts a probability value for each tested sequence and states if sequence is anomalous or not. A numerical example is also shown in this article that calculates the most optimal sequence of observations for both HMM and state sequence probabilities in case a HMM model is already given.

abstract={Due to the rapid increment of the cyber attacks, intrusion detection system (IDS) is shifting towards collaborative approaches. There is a huge demand for securing larger networking environments for providing a safeguard against threats. In order to optimize the feasible detection performance, Collaborative Intrusion Detection Networks (CIDN) approaches have been adopted in practical scenarios, which enables a group of IDS nodes to mutually share and exchange mandatory information with each other, for example, IDS-signatures, attacks alarms. However, CIDN networks are distributed in nature, such networks still face plenty of implementation problems, especially, insider intruder can easily dominate any of security node and leave the entire security system vulnerable. To achieve the trust-based communication between each of IDS node, the recent advancement in blockchain applications is considered as a good fit to create trust-based communication in CIDN networks. This work converges CIDN network and blockchain in SDN context. Firstly, we investigated existing related work and highlighted challenges and research gap towards blockchain in CIDN networks. Secondly, we utilised three collaborated Snort IDS to receive the latest signature update from Ryu and then to securely share such signatures updates to all other Snort nodes within test-bed. Our work is motivated to detect seven types of common attacks with collaborated signature-based IDS, which feasibly processes more packets to achieve satisfactory detection results. Overall the evaluation results show that with the adoption of blockchain protocols, the proposed CIDN network achieves 96% of TP rate detection rate for TCP, UDP and ICMP packets. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Emerging intelligent systems have stringent constraints including cost and power consumption. When they are used in critical applications, resiliency becomes another key requirement. Much research into techniques for fault tolerance and dependability has been successfully applied to highly critical systems, such as those used in space, where cost is not an overriding constraint. Further, most resiliency techniques were focused on dealing with failures in the hardware and bugs in the software. The next generation of systems used in critical applications will also have to be tolerant to test escapes after manufacturing, soft errors and transients in the electronics, hardware bugs, hardware and software Trojans and viruses, as well as intrusions and other security attacks during operation. This paper will assess the impact of these threats on the results produced by a critical system, and proposed solutions to each of them. It is argued that run-time checks at the application-level are necessary to deal with errors in the results. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, the industrial control systems (ICS) face many challenges, where security is becoming one of the most crucial. This fact is caused by new connected environment, which brings among new possibilities also new vulnerabilities, threats, or possible attacks. The criminal acts in the ICS area increased over the past years exponentially, which caused the loss of billions of dollars. This also caused classical Intrusion Detection Systems and Intrusion Prevention Systems to evolve in order to protect among IT also ICS networks. However, these systems need sufficient data such as traffic logs, protocol information, attack patterns, anomaly behavior marks and many others. To provide such data, the requirements for the test environment are summarized in this paper. Moreover, we also introduce more than twenty common vulnerabilities across the ICS together with information about possible risk, attack vector (point), possible detection methods and communication layer occurrence. Therefore, the paper might be used as a base-ground for building sufficient data generator for machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms often used in ICS/IDS systems. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In view of the automotive cybersecurity incidents occur frequently with no evaluation standard, a comprehensive evaluation method is proposed, which firstly reviews the process of obtaining automotive cybersecurity goals and function requirements through threat analysis and risk assessment. Then the international research projects on automotive cybersecurity and the key issues are summarized. It is proposed to score (0-100) from the three dimensions of cybersecurity level, intelligent level and incident response capacity of enterprise, and then comprehensively evaluate the cybersecurity performance level of automobile. Cybersecurity level includes concept design of cybersecurity, verification of protection scheme and penetration test. We conducted penetration testing from seven aspects, including network architecture, ECU, T-box, Radio, IVI, cloud Platform, APP. To all, there are 30 test groups, including software security, hardware security, communication security, identity authentication, data security, etc., a total of 108 test items. The intelligent level is evaluated according to 40 documents of 5 categories, and the enterprise's incident response capacity is evaluated according to 20 documents of 5 categories. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is adopted to determine the weight distribution of cybersecurity level, intelligent level and incident response capacity of enterprise. To ensure the reasonableness of weight coefficient allocation, 50 people with different gender, occupation and education background were invited to fill in the questionnaire. A specific scoring method for three dimensions is given and the comprehensive evaluation case of vehicle information security is given. Finally, the finiteness of this method is summarized, and it is pointed out that it can be further studied in the aspect of vulnerability rating specification and document review rules. © 2019 SAE International.

abstract={With the rapid advancements of ubiquitous information and communication technologies, a large number of trustworthy online systems and services have been deployed. However, cybersecurity threats are still mounting. An intrusion detection (ID) system can play a significant role in detecting such security threats. Thus, developing an intelligent and accurate ID system is a non-trivial research problem. Existing ID systems that are typically used in traditional network intrusion detection system often fail and cannot detect many known and new security threats, largely because those approaches are based on classical machine learning methods that provide less focus on accurate feature selection and classification. Consequently, many known signatures from the attack traffic remain unidentifiable and become latent. Furthermore, since a massive network infrastructure can produce large-scale data, these approaches often fail to handle them flexibly, hence are not scalable. To address these issues and improve the accuracy and scalability, we propose a scalable and hybrid IDS, which is based on Spark ML and the convolutional-LSTM (Conv-LSTM) network. This IDS is a two-stage ID system: the first stage employs the anomaly detection module, which is based on Spark ML. The second stage acts as a misuse detection module, which is based on the Conv-LSTM network, such that both global and local latent threat signatures can be addressed. Evaluations of several baseline models in the ISCX-UNB dataset show that our hybrid IDS can identify network misuses accurately in 97.29% of cases and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches during 10-fold cross-validation tests. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={this paper proposes a new system of ensuring data governance and enhancing data security in private cloud environment. Security and Privacy concerns have been the major drawbacks in cloud computing environments. Security, reliability and privacy enhance users' flexibility in file accessibility. As easy-to-use cloud services penetrate personal computing, users expect to enjoy the same conveniences they have at home in the office. This paper proposes a workable security technique in a cloud computing environment that delivers Infrastructure as a Service (SaaS), and deployed in a Private Cloud to protect data and information stored and shared from potential intrusion, threats, theft, virus, and agents. This paper proposes a system that focuses on data encryption and CAPTCHA methods as regards to security solutions. This paper adopted the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) for the development, and implementation of the new system. Java play framework is adopted for the implementation of the web based system. The database structure is handled be employing MySQL. The system was implemented and tested using the various test cases which were successful. The test result shows that the proposed method is efficient in data confidentiality, integrity and availability. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Critical infrastructure experienced a transformation from isolated towards highly (inter-)connected systems. This development introduced a variety of new cyber threats, causing high financial damage, threatening lives and affecting the society. Known examples are Stuxnet, WannaCry and the attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. To prevent such attacks, it is indispensable to properly design, assess and maintain countermeasures and security strategies throughout the whole life cycle of the critical systems. For this, security has to be considered and assessed for every system design and redesign. However, common assessment tools and methodologies are not executed on a detailed system knowledge and therefore they are enhanced with penetration tests. Unfortunately, performing only abstract assessments is inadequate and penetration tests endanger the availability of the tested systems. Therefore, the latter cannot be performed on live systems executing critical processes. In this paper, we address these issues for Industrial Control Systems and explain how new concepts for continuous security-by-design or model-based system monitoring and automated vulnerability assessments can resolve them by exploiting new Industry 4.0 developments. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Purpose: Phishing is one of the major threats affecting businesses worldwide in current times. Organizations and customers face the hazards arising out of phishing attacks because of anonymous access to vulnerable details. Such attacks often result in substantial financial losses. Thus, there is a need for effective intrusion detection techniques to identify and possibly nullify the effects of phishing. Classifying phishing and non-phishing web content is a critical task in information security protocols, and full-proof mechanisms have yet to be implemented in practice. The purpose of the current study is to present an ensemble machine learning model for classifying phishing websites. Design/methodology/approach: A publicly available data set comprising 10,068 instances of phishing and legitimate websites was used to build the classifier model. Feature extraction was performed by deploying a group of methods, and relevant features extracted were used for building the model. A twofold ensemble learner was developed by integrating results from random forest (RF) classifier, fed into a feedforward neural network (NN). Performance of the ensemble classifier was validated using k-fold cross-validation. The twofold ensemble learner was implemented as a user-friendly, interactive decision support system for classifying websites as phishing or legitimate ones. Findings: Experimental simulations were performed to access and compare the performance of the ensemble classifiers. The statistical tests estimated that RF_NN model gave superior performance with an accuracy of 93.41 per cent and minimal mean squared error of 0.000026. Research limitations/implications: The research data set used in this study is publically available and easy to analyze. Comparative analysis with other real-time data sets of recent origin must be performed to ensure generalization of the model against various security breaches. Different variants of phishing threats must be detected rather than focusing particularly toward phishing website detection. Originality/value: The twofold ensemble model is not applied for classification of phishing websites in any previous studies as per the knowledge of authors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={We are currently experiencing the fourth industrial revolution. This is what the German government initiative, first, has identified with ‘Industry 4.0’. The manufacturing future will be marked and will go through the new automation technologies that are being introduced with Industrial Internet of Things (I2oT). Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are exploiting I2oT for reducing costs and improving efficiency. However, ICSs are already jeopardized by an increasingly large set of threat vectors. Those threats are used by malicious actors to misuse physical Critical Infrastructures that usually are vital services for well-being. I2oT implementation increases the threat surface, generating new possible vulnerabilities. Information Technology (IT) classical approaches to cyber attacks cannot be applied to ICS due to their extreme differences from main priorities to resource constrains. Therefore, innovative approaches and equipment must be developed to suit with ICS world. In this paper, a Smart Behavioural Filter (SBF) for the PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) is proposed aiming to secure the PLC itself against logic attacks, that are stealth for other more classical security approaches. An example of the considered logic attacks is many open and close commands towards a valve in a short time. Those logic attacks are usually a sequence of well-formed packets in which the content represents an anomalous and unpredicted behaviour. This smart field equipment can react in short time to cyber attacks isolating the PLC, communicate with other equipment like itself and increasing in general the resilience of the physical system. It can also generate alarms for the local Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The proposed equipment has been developed and validated in a real test-bed within the FP7 CockpitCI project and H2020 ATENA project. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) are vital for countries’ industrial facilities and critical infrastructures. However, there are not enough security assessments against cyber attacks carried out on ICS for not preventing business continuity. New attacks are being made every day against these systems. Threats and attacks against critical infrastructures must be detected for protecting human life and assets. For this reason, detection has become more important than the prevention of attacks. In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the critical systems. In the analysis, mirroring technique was used to prevent the detection system from imposing additional load to the existing system and affecting the operation of the system negatively. In the test environment, Siemens S-7 1200 (Firmware 2.2) PLC devices were used. Smoothsec system, which is not used in industrial systems, is used for detection and rule table. It is assessed that this novel approach will provide significant contributions to attract attention to vulnerabilities and the security analysis of industrial control systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Threats to network security increase with growing volumes and velocity of data across networks, and they present challenges not only to law enforcement agencies, but to businesses, families and individuals. The volume, velocity and veracity of shared data across networks entail accurate and reliable automated tools for filtering out useful from malicious, noisy or irrelevant data. While data mining and machine learning techniques have widely been adopted within the network security community, challenges and gaps in knowledge extraction from data have remained due to insufficient data sources on attacks on which to test the algorithms accuracy and reliability. We propose a data-flow adaptive approach to intrusion detection based on high-dimensional cyber-attacks data. The algorithm repeatedly takes random samples from an inherently bi-modal, high-dimensional dataset of 82,332 observations on 25 numeric and two categorical variables. Its main idea is to capture subtle information resulting from reduced data dimension of a large number of malicious flows and by iteratively estimating roles played by individual variables in construction of key components. Data visualization and numerical results provide a clear separation of a set of variables associated with attack types and show that component-dominating parameters are crucial in monitoring future attacks. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={SQL Injection Attacks are one of the most common methods behind data security breaches. Previous research has attempted to produce viable detection solutions in order to filter SQL Injection Attacks from regular queries. Unfortunately it has proven to be a challenging problem with many solutions suffering from disadvantages such as being unable to process in real time as a preventative solution, a lack of adaptability to differing types of attack and the requirement for access to difficult-to-obtain information about the source application. This paper presents a novel solution of classifying SQL queries purely on the features of the initial query string. A Gap-Weighted String Subsequence Kernel algorithm is implemented to identify subsequences of shared characters between query strings for the output of a similarity metric. Finally a Support Vector Machine is trained on the similarity metrics between known query strings which are then used to classify unknown test queries. By gathering all feature data from the query strings, additional information from the source application is not required. The probabilistic nature of the learned models allows the solution to adapt to new threats whilst in operation. The proposed solution is evaluated using a number of test datasets derived from the Amnesia testbed datasets. The demonstration software achieved 97.07% accuracy for Select type queries and 92.48% accuracy for Insert type queries. This limited success rate is due to unsanitized quotation marks within legitimate inputs confusing the feature extraction. Using a test dataset that denies legitimate queries the use of unsanitized quotation marks, the Select and Insert query accuracy rose. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The HPC Architecture for Cyber Situational Awareness (HACSAW) was established by the Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) to combine a rich computational environment with operationally relevant data to perform cutting-edge cybersecurity research that will increase HPCMP’s current and predictive understanding of cyberspace on the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN). The data repository created by this unique environment includes the collection of unclassified data sources from the edge of the network (i.e., Internet Access Points) down to the host-level, across more than one hundred (100) different DoD enclaves. Through the application of high performance computing (HPC) resources, HACSAW explores novel and innovative analytical capabilities based on a comprehensive cybersecurity dataset. The integration of HPC within the cyber work-flow provides an opportunity for fusion and assessments of disparate data streams and real-time analysis using data science algorithms and machine learning (both structured and unstructured data). Our approach is designed to ultimately leverage HPC resources to significantly reduce the time to respond to changes in the cyber environment from days to minutes. Understanding the operational status of information systems, the missions (friendly and adversary) being pursued, and the threats and vulnerabilities that impact them is essential for effective mission accomplishment. This understanding is referred to as Cyberspace Situational Awareness (Cyber SA). Today’s decision makers require meaningful Cyber SA to safeguard sensitive data, sustain fundamental operations, and protect national infrastructure [2]. The need and responsibility of Cyber SA spans multiple organizations within the DoD, across the entire government and in the private sector. The lack of relevant and recent real-world network enterprise data has hampered many cybersecurity research efforts to develop and validate algorithms or methods under realistic conditions. HACSAW has reduced this technical barrier with a development environment that provides computational and data-rich information to researchers to test, develop, model, measure and refine data-driven analytics. This environment is the proving ground for novel ideas, algorithms and approaches that are suitable for large scale execution in a dedicated HPC environment. Currently, HACSAW as an aggregation of over one (1) petabyte of DREN data to include network-based monitoring and intrusion detection results, web content filtering, vulnerability scanning, firewall, sensor health, etc. Context is applied to each cyber event through the use of custom enrichments that provide downstream analytical processes with information that may be useful in determining the nature of the event. During this talk, we will discuss HPCMP’s initial approach to addressing Cyber SA through a Call for Proposals (CFP) to the data science, cyber, and HPC communities. Selected collaborators will receive funding for a one-year effort that demonstrates potential for integration into DREN’s Cyber SA operational environment and aligns with identified Mission Essential Tasks (METs). METs will ensure decision makers have the understanding necessary to make effective decisions. Such tasks include monitoring, detection, alerting, cyber threat analysis, cyber risk and event analysis, and sharing and collaboration. Initial and future contributions in the areas of modeling and simulation [4], clustering [3] and deep learning [1] are anticipated and results will be shared at a later date. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) permeates society in many areas, such as automotive, smart-homes, smart-cities, healthcare, and critical infrastructures. Even if the IoT promises economic growth as well as convenience for users, the security (and safety) implications of the IoT are equally significant. In fact, weak security in IoT devices could have dangerous consequences, such as to a car crash, or an intruder entering in our home. As an example, in October 2016, the distributed denial of service attack on Dyn, a company controlling and managing several DNS services, brought down most of America’s Internet, and was caused by an IoT botnet (Mirai). This is mainly due to an increasing number of vulnerabilities in IoT devices being discovered on a daily basis, and that are the consequence of poor IoT security practices. To properly address the security and testing of IoT devices, the first step is the description of a threat model. However, few IoT manufactures base their testing on sound threat modelling techniques and comprehensive IoT security guidelines. For these reasons, in this paper we propose a methodological approach for IoT security testing, which extends the OWASP IoT framework to include threat models to guide the selection of tests used to evaluate IoT attack surfaces and associated vulnerabilities. In addition, the proposed extended framework includes indications on how to actually test a given vulnerability and a set of recommended tools for performing the tests. To this end, we have devised a set of procedures associated with the tests, e.g. accessing device hardware or resetting the device. We also describe a set of tests based on the framework we have performed on IoT devices to test their security. In particular, we have tested the framework on a home router, a relatively cheap baby monitor, and a pricey security system. The methodological testing of the devices reported that the baby monitor showed signs of inadequate security, the router patching any known vulnerabilities as expected from a well-known manufacturer, and the security system quashing any penetration testing attempts. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={For many years, cyber security in both Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian industries has been a compliance driven process. Respective organizations define rules or best practices that direct their Information Technology (IT) systems to comply to. Success is often measured by how well these static rules are followed, and how many security incidents have been discovered compared to historical data. There is a multitude of problems associated with this simplistic approach. First, cyber threats are constantly evolving; it was previously estimated that as many as 400,000 new malware are being introduced each day. Most of these threats are specifically targeting a given system and/or designed to succeed in certain attack vector. Adapting a cookie-cutting, one-size-fits-all cyber security policy that only gets reviewed/updated periodically might not be adequate. From the technical standpoint, even the best commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) anti-virus/anti-malware software relies on regular database updates of known threats. Hence, by definition, these forms of protection can only provide remediation for existing threats; systems are basically defenseless against specific zero-day threats that are specifically designed to attack these systems. A more comprehensive approach toward cyber security should be adapted to defend against these evolving threats. With the pervasive nature of the Internet, previously disparate industries are now more interwoven together than ever before. In the United States, if a cyber attack is to happen in the power grid infrastructure, it is conceivable the impacts could be spread to public safety, health, national defense, banking and finance sectors. Not only might impacts be felt across industries, but the threat profiles of these attacks may hold similarities as well due to common vulnerabilities across IT and Operation Technology (OT) systems. Hence, it is crucial to determine how different industries are addressing the cyber security challenges they are each facing. This paper will provide a brief survey of best practices in cyber security in several industries, including DoD, oil/gas industries and banking/financial institutions. There are many similarities in the way these industries are each approaching the cyber security challenges. At the same time, there are significant differences in the specific threats they are facing. For example, the DoD is beginning to shift its focus from generic penetration tests and risk management framework evaluations to using cyber range testing and simulation-based threat assessment that systematically evaluate military systems and platforms under a variety of operational conditions. The oil/gas energy companies are also starting to identify their most vulnerable systems and subsystem components. For example, they work with industrial control system (ICS) vendors and suppliers to improve their products’ cyber security performance-both at the individual unit level as well as the network protocol layer. The banking and financial institutions are facing cyber attackers with different motivations than those targeting the DoD systems. Instead of crippling or destroying the targeted systems, the cyber criminals in the banking/financial industries are often more focusing on deception and data exfiltration, even though they also use similar tactics, techniques, procedures (TTP) such as phishing, waterhole attack, etc. like the cyber attackers in other industries. Although the aforementioned industries are facing cyber attackers with different motivations, many of the threat vectors and methodologies are actually very similar. Hence, it would be beneficial if cyber experts in these industries could share threat information, and collaborate to define cyber best practices. A complementary approach is to establish a cyber simulation environment that allows individual organizations to provide their threat models, and that these models can be shared across multiple industries. © Winter Simulation Innovation Workshop, SIW 2018.

abstract={Modern Department of Defense mission systems are very complex and therefore arduous to defend, especially in the cyber domain. A major cause for this concern arises from the fact that implementation of security protections occur at a local scale, while the important operational security issues stem from a global perspective of the system, e.g., mission assurance. Being able to understand network-wide implications of local cyber protections has the potential to significantly impact the strategies we use to protect modern mission systems. In this work, we present a graph-theoretic perspective on this problem, which is based on a framework for modeling and assessing the integrated cyber-physical dynamics of complex systems. Under the framework, these dynamics (and their relationships) are modeled as a graph and then analyzed using processing techniques from graphtheory. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by conducting insider-attack threat analysis and show how the application of security protections at a local scale impact network-wide security properties from an insider perspective. As a test case, we study the problem of search and rescue (SAR) using unmanned aerial vehicle teams. Unmanned vehicle teams engaged in SAR are prototypical cyber-physical systems, in which local intrusions may cause global disruptions. Here, we describe how the insider modeling framework for cyber-physical dynamics applies to this problem and present results of a network-wide assessment of security properties of the system. We use this assessment to design a security protection for the system in which we use cryptographically secure computation techniques to limit the amount of information sharing required between system components without degrading the correct operation of the system. We show how the application of these techniques on a local scale impacts the security properties of the system on a global scale. © 2018 SPIE.},

abstract={With thousands of alerts identified by IDSs every day, the process of distinguishing which alerts are important (i.e., true positives) and which are is irrelevant (i.e., false positives) is become more complicated. The security administrator must analyze each single alert either a true of false alert. This paper proposes an alert prioritization model, which is based on risk assessment. The model uses indicators, such as priority, reliability, asset value, as decision factors to calculate alert's risk. The objective is to determine the impact of certain alerts generated by IDS on the security status of an information system, also improve the detection of intrusions using snort by classifying the most critical alerts by their levels of risk, thus, only the alerts that presents a real threat will be displayed to the security administrator, so, we reduce the number of false positives, also we minimize the analysis time of the alerts. The model was evaluated using KDD Cup 99 Dataset as test environment and a pattern matching algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are jeopardized from a large set of threat vectors, which exploit their vulnerabilities in order to impact the physical Critical Infrastructures they control. The Information Technology (IT) classical approach to cyber attacks can not be applied to ICS due to their extreme differences from main priorities to resource constrains. Therefore, innovative approaches and equipment must be developed in order to suit with ICS world. In this paper, a Smart Behavioural Filter (SBF) for the PLCs/RTUs is proposed aiming to secure the PLC/RTU itself against logic attacks, that are stealth for other more classical security approaches. Those logic attacks are usually anomaly behaviours, for instance a large number of open/close commands towards a valve. This smart field equipment can communicate with other equipment like itself in order to react in short time to cyber attacks and increase the resilience of the physical system. It can also generate alarms for the local Intrusion Detection System (IDS) The proposed equipment has been developed and validated in a real test-bed within the FP7 CockpitCI project. The results are promising. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017.},

abstract={Red teams play a critical part in assessing the security of a network by actively probing it for weakness and vulnerabilities. Unlike penetration testing - which is typically focused on exploiting vulnerabilities - red teams assess the entire state of a network by emulating real adversaries, including their techniques, tactics, procedures, and goals. Unfortunately, deploying red teams is prohibitive: cost, repeatability, and expertise all make it difficult to consistently employ red team tests. We seek to solve this problem by creating a framework for automated red team emulation, focused on what the red team does post-compromise - i.e., after the perimeter has been breached. Here, our program acts as an automated and intelligent red team, actively moving through the target network to test for weaknesses and train defenders. At its core, our framework uses an automated planner designed to accurately reason about future plans in the face of the vast amount of uncertainty in red teaming scenarios. Our solution is custom-developed, built on a logical encoding of the cyber environment and adversary profiles, using techniques from classical planning, Markov decision processes, and Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper, we report on the development of our framework, focusing on our planning system. We have successfully validated our planner against other techniques via a custom simulation. Our tool itself has successfully been deployed to identify vulnerabilities and is currently used to train defending blue teams.},

abstract={Cognitive radios are currently presented as the solution to the ever-increasing spectrum shortage problem. However, their increased capabilities over traditional radios introduce a new dimension of security threats. Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) has been proposed as a means to protect cognitive radio networks from the well-known security threats: primary user emulation (PUE) and spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF). In this paper, we demonstrate a new threat to CSS protocols that rely on sensor reputations, called the Rogue Signal Framing (RSF) intrusion. Rogue signals can be exploited to create the illusion of malicious sensors which leads to the framing of innocent sensors and, consequently, their removal from the shared spectrum sensing. Ultimately, with fewer sensors working together, the spectrum sensing is less robust for making correct spectrum access decisions. The simulation experiments illustrate the impact of RSF intrusions which, in severe cases, shows roughly 40% of sensors removed. To counter the RSF’s impact on the cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), we introduce a new defense based on cluster analysis and community detection from analyzing the network’s received signal strength (RSS) diversity. Tests show up to 95% damage mitigation to the integrity of sensor reputations, thus retaining the benefits of trust-based CSS protocols. © 2015, Jackson et al.; licensee Springer.},

abstract={To reap the benefits of prognostic health management, intelligent Test Program Set (TPS) diagnostic reasoning, and remote TPS configuration management Automated Test Systems (ATSs) must be networked in spite of increasing cybersecurity concerns. Traditional cybersecurity tools such as Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), firewalls and antivirus software are continuously proven vulnerable to the increasing sophistication of bad actors and insider threats. In addition, these software security appliances and their recurring updates can be burdensome to TPS development and interfere with TPS performance. This paper describes a hardware-based whitelisting tool that addresses these concerns. In this system each executable file is cryptographically sealed and a hardware appliance serves as the secure key manager to eliminate untrusted file execution and trusted file tampering. It can also be used to separate the computer administrator from the security administrator role to mitigate insider threats. Another benefit of whitelisting an ATS in this way is the capability to enforce configuration management in the Automated Test Equipment (ATE) operating system, system software and TPSs. A method for remotely managing a network of hardware-based whitelisting secured ATSs is outlined including the creation and distribution of whitelists and updates. A related security logging feature is also described and performance testing with and without hardware-based whitelisting on an ATS is reported. Multiple hardware form factors (current and future) are explored in addition to a range of customizable features including security levels, Trusted Platform Module (TPM) integration, memory forensics, hardware-enforced encryption and a trusted network interface. Assured net-centric ATSs are not a goal unto themselves but a gateway to increased affordability, interoperability, and using ATS data to achieve greater benefits from logistics information systems. Hardwarebased whitelisting gives additional piece of mind beyond traditional cybersecurity methods that the systems we use to interface flight hardware will not be used as a malicious vector. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Insider threats are evolving constantly and misuse the granted resource access for various malicious activities. These insider threats make use of internal network flaws as the loop holes and are the root cause for data exfiltration and infiltration (Data leakage). Organizations are devising and deploying new solutions for analyzing, monitoring and predicting these insider threats. However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem. The objective of this research is to develop a Complex Event Processing (CEP) based Hybrid IDS that integrates the output of the Host IDS and Network IDS into the CEP Module and produces a consolidated output with higher accuracy. The overall deployment protects the internal information system without any data leakage by Stateful Packet Inspection. Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) is used to estimate and characterize the normal behavior of the network and send the values to the CEP Engine which alerts in case of any deviation from the normal pattern. The performance of the proposed Hybrid IDS is examined using test bed with normal and various attack scenarios. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, several threats endanger cyber-physical systems. Among these systems, industrial control systems (ICS) operating on critical infrastructures have been proven to be an attractive target for attackers. The case of Stuxnet has not only showed that ICSs are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, but also that some of these attacks rely on understanding the processes beyond the employed systems and using such knowledge to maximize the damage. This concept is commonly known as "semantic attack". Our paper discusses a specific type of semantic attack involving "sequences of events". Common network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) generally search for single, unusual or "not permitted" operations. In our case, rather than a malicious event, we show how a specific series of "permitted" operations can elude standard intrusion detection systems and still damage an infrastructure. Moreover, we present a possible approach to the development of a sequence-aware intrusion detection system (S-IDS). We propose a S-IDS reference architecture and we discuss all the steps through its implementations. Finally, we test the S-IDS on real ICS traffic samples captured from a water treatment and purification facility. is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={Though Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have gained widespread popularity for several applications in recent years, safely sharing the airspace with other manned aircraft has been a significant challenge facing the industry. The inability of UAS to Sense and Avoid (SAA) other air traffic remains as a major technology barrier in integrating UAS into the National Airspace Systems (NAS). Small UAS (Group 3 and below) pose additional integration challenges due to their small size, slow speed, peculiar flight paths, and limited payload capacities. UtopiaCompression Corporation (UC) is developing a light-weight, affordable, all-passive, vision-based sense-and-avoid (VBSAA) solution suitable for UAS with limited Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) availability. Particularly, the VBSAA solution addresses several aspects of SAA including intruder detection, tracking, range estimation, and collision threat prediction. The VBSAA solution offers the unique ability to provide a 3D estimate of the intruder's position using only passive EO/IR sensors without the need for ownship maneuvers. To demonstrate the VBSAA solution, UC is conducting SAA flight tests using a Group 3 UAS and a manned Cessna aircraft. We present a brief description of our system components, functionalities of our algorithms, platform integration, flight test encounters and preliminary results to validate the feasibility of our solution.},

abstract={With the volume of Internet communication continuing to increase, there are more cases of worm and virus intrusion through the network. The security system against external attacks that use various security vulnerabilities consists of firewall and intrusion detection and prevention subsystem, and its functionality is becoming more advanced. As indicated by the recent security issues and intrusion cases, however, APT attacks and worm and hacking must be dealt with continuously. As such, enterprises are investing in various measures for an integrated security system to identify the threats of network security-based security vulnerabilities and cope with theme effectively. This paper proposes a network packet in-depth test-based, integrated security system that analyzes the threat factors through a total study of network packets circulated in realtime and applies various security functions to cope with intelligent security threats in the future. © 2014 SERSC.},

abstract={Capacity of the sensor network is always a bottleneck problem for the novel FBG-based quasi-distributed fiberoptical defending system. In this paper, a highly sensitive sensing network with FBG vibration sensors is presented to relieve stress of the capacity and the system cost. However, higher sensitivity may cause higher Nuisance Alarm Rates (NARs) in practical uses. It is necessary to further classify the intrusion pattern or threat level and determine the validity of an unexpected event. Then an intelligent identification method is proposed by extracting the statistical features of the vibration signals in the time domain, and inputting them into a 3-layer Back-Propagation(BP) Artificial Neural Network to classify the events of interest. Experiments of both simulation and field tests are carried out to validate its effectiveness. The results show the recognition rate can be achieved up to 100% for the simulation signals and as high as 96.03% in the real tests. © 2013 SPIE.},

abstract={Lack of security is a constant concern in open distributed systems. Because of this problem, many tools for evaluating vulnerabilities of networks, as well as for their protection, are being developed and largely deployed; for example, techniques for encryption, antivirus, firewall, and IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems). Among these, there are IDSs that are increasingly conceived, designed, and implemented. Currently, IDSs are created using software agents. Although IDSs can provide intrusion detection and countermeasures against threats, they are subjected to attacks. Thus, it is necessary to ensure security for IDSs. This chapter proposes a framework for providing self-security, self-reliability of message exchange, self-reliability of components, and self-integrity for IDSs based on agents. The proposed solution is implemented as an extension of the IDS-NIDIA (Network Intrusion Detection System Based on Intelligent Agents), whose architecture has an intelligent agent society that communicates in a cooperative way in a distributed environment. Some tests show the applicability of the proposed solution. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose - Anomaly detection of network attacks has become a high priority because of the need to guarantee security, privacy and reliability. This work aims to describe both intelligent immunological approaches and traditional monitoring systems for anomaly detection. Design/methodology/approach - Author investigated different artificial immune system (AIS) theories and proposes how to combine different ideas to solve problems of network security domain. An anomaly detection system that applies those ideas was built and tested in a real time environment, to test the pros and cons of AIS and clarify its applicability. Rather than building a detailed signature based model of intrusion detection system, the scope of this study tries to explore the principle in an immune network focusing on its self-organization, adaptive learning capability, and immune feedback. Findings - The natural immune system has its own intelligent mechanisms to detect the foreign bodies and fight them and without it, an individual cannot live, even just for several days. Network attackers evolved new types of attacks. Attacks became more complex, severe and hard to detect. This results in increasing needs for network defense systems, especially those with ability to extraordinary approaches or to face the dynamic nature of continuously changing network threats. KDD CUP'99 dataset are used as a training data to evaluate the proposed hybrid artificial immune principles anomaly detection. The average cost of the proposed model was 0.1195 where that the wining of KDD99 dataset computation had 0.233. Originality/value - It is original to introduce investigation on the vaccination biological process. A special module was built to perform this process and check its usage and how it could be formulated in artificial life. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The development of the mobile Internet brought about by the thriving mobile intelligent terminals has made it possible to access to the Internet anytime and anywhere. While people enjoy the convenience, they also suffer from a series of security threats caused by cyber-attacks. IPS brings reliability and security in a network system and is regarded as one of the most popular security devices. However, the conventional IPS deployment often has some limitations, and the deployment and maintenance costs are expensive, the utilization rate is low. In order to solve these issues, an SDN-based IPS deployment is presented in this paper, which supports a unified scheduling of security applications in the whole network and load balancing among IPSs. In addition, this paper builds a test-bed and shows evaluation results. As the results, It is confirmed that the proposed scheme can achieve a shorter time for ping after the first ping and that with the load balancing, the network latency is significantly reduced. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The depth-of-penetration (DOP) test has been modified for application to transparent armor materials. Armor materials to be tested are bonded to a polycarbonate substrate and penetration into the substrate measured. The tests can be used both for comparing armor materials and for evaluating laminate parameters. Materials tested were all armor-grade transparencies: borosilicate glass, soda-lime glass, glass ceramic, and spinel. For blunt projectiles, armor material performance is inversely correlated with density. For hard, sharp projectiles, material strength is most important, with spinel providing the best performance. The efficiency of spinel-glass laminates was only weakly dependent on the spinel thickness. Linear scaling can reconcile data obtained with different size projectiles. Relatively thick bond layers do not adversely affect the efficiency of laminates. DOP tests can be used to evaluate effects of damage from single cracks and multiple hits, and results also provide an estimate of optimal armor design against the threat used in the DOP experiments. © 2012 Society for Experimental Mechanics.},

Common intrusion detection methods lack the ability to detect such - what are commonly termed - advanced persistent threats. A new approach is needed that takes the stepwise characteristics of this type of threats into account and links analysis methods to attack features. This paper takes up this challenge. First, an analysis framework is proposed to relate complex attack attributes to detection and business aspects. Second, the framework is used to define a development roadmap for designing advanced intrusion detection systems, such systems can analyze network traffic and client data at multiple network locations using both signature and anomaly detection methods derived from the intelligent data analysis field. Third, a test case is provided showing the potential power of the proposed development roadmap. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless technology is a central component of many factory automation infrastructures in both the commercial and government sectors, providing connectivity among various components in industrial realms (distributed sensors, machines, mobile process controllers). However wireless technologies provide more threats to computer security than wired environments. The advantageous features of Bluetooth technology resulted in Bluetooth units shipments climbing to five million per week at the end of 2005 [1, 2]. This is why the real-time interpretation and understanding of Bluetooth traffic behavior is critical in both maintaining the integrity of computer systems and increasing the efficient use of this technology in control type applications. Although neuro-fuzzy approaches have been applied to wireless 802.11 behavior analysis in the past, a significantly different Bluetooth protocol framework has not been extensively explored using this technology. This paper presents a new neuro-fuzzy traffic analysis algorithm of this still new territory of Bluetooth traffic. Further enhancements of this algorithm are presented along with the comparison against the traditional, numerical approach. Through test examples, interesting Bluetooth traffic behavior characteristics were captured, and the comparative elegance of this computationally inexpensive approach was demonstrated. This analysis can be used to provide directions for future development and use of this prevailing technology in various control type applications, as well as making the use of it more secure. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Although sharing the same physical infrastructure with data networks makes convergence attractive, it also makes Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks and applications inherit all the security weaknesses of IP protocol. In addition, VoIP converged networks come with their own set of security concerns. Voice traffic on converged networks is packet switched and vulnerable to interception with the same techniques used to sniff other traffic on a LAN or WAN. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are one of the most critical threats to VoIP due to the disruption of service and loss of revenue they cause. VoIP systems are supposed to provide the same level of security provided by traditional PSTN networks, although more functionality and intelligence are distributed to the endpoints, and more protocols are involved to provide better service. All these factors make a new design and techniques in Intrusion Detection highly needed. In this paper we propose a novel host based intrusion detection architecture for converged VoIP applications. Our architecture uses the Communicating Extended Finite State Machines formal model to provide both stateful and cross-protocol detection. In addition, it combines signature-based and specification-based detection techniques alongside combining protocol syntax and semantics anomaly detection. A variety of attacks are implemented on our test bed, and the intrusion detection prototype shows promising efficiency. The accuracy of the prototype detection is discussed and analyzed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={Society has grown to rely on Internet services, and the number of Internet users increases every day. As more and more users become connected to the network, the window of opportunity for malicious users to do their damage becomes very great and lucrative. The computer industry is combating the rising threat of malicious activity with new hardware and software products such as Intrusion Detection Systems, Intrusion Prevention Systems, and Firewalls. However, malicious users are constantly looking for ways to by-pass the security features of these products, and many times they will succeed. This paper describes a novel concept implemented for the purpose of computer and network security with hopes of using it to combat malicious user activity. A hybrid-intelligent system based on Bayesian Learning Networks and Self-Organizing Maps was created and used for classifying network and host based data collected within a Local Area Network. The KDD-CUP-99 data set was used to test this classification system, and the experimental results show that there is an advantage to using a hybrid system such as this because there was a significant improvement in classification accuracy compared to a non-hybrid Bayesian Learning approach when network-only data is used for classification.

abstract={flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow will get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on the concept of flow aggregation management architecture [15], we present a Flow-based Congestion Control (FCC) architecture that consists of a Flow-based Quality-of-Service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multi-level packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection [15] is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Results showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks. ©2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Zero-day attacks, new (anomalous) attacks exploiting previously unknown system vulnerabilities, are a serious threat. Defending against them is no easy task, however. Having identified "degree of system knowledge" as one difference between legitimate and illegitimate users, theorists have drawn on information theory as a basis for intrusion detection. In particular, Kolmogorov complexity (K) has been used successfully. In this work, we consider information distance (Observed_K - Expected_K) as a method of detecting system scans. Observed_K is computed directly, Expected_K is taken from compression tests shared herein. Results are encouraging. Observed scan traffic has an information distance at least an order of magnitude greater than the threshold value we determined for normal Internet traffic. With 320 KB packet blocks, separation between distributions appears to exceed 4σ. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={The objective of this work is to investigate the security requirements and strategies for intelligent mobile robots, perform tests to determine strengths and weaknesses of test bed platforms, and develop counter strategies to improve security of the test bed platforms. This research will discuss the implications of these results on large scale ongoing efforts in mobile robotics. Potential security threats range from accidental intrusion of the device's hardware or software by untrained personnel to deliberate "spoofing" of sensor suites by unauthorized users or enemies. © 1987 SPIE.
