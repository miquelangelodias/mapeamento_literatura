abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform consists of purpose-driven communication controllers, enterprise-grade modems (routers and gateways), and edge computing systems that require integrated software and sensing capability in mission-critical environments. Extensible purpose-built industrial supervisory control and data acquisition networks are prone to numerous cybersecurity threats. In this paper, the historical databased qualitative threat assessment was part of the comprehensive risk breakdown (i.e., to quantify assessment and remediation) of the practicing industry (i.e., systems that rely on robotics, big data & analytics). Furthermore, a risk and operability (HAZOP & convolution neural-network) evaluation was proved to be the paramount study for autonomous vulnerability assessment. Through autonomous network management, continuous software monitoring, data-driven device insights, and integrated content filtering, the proposed endpoint protection scheme shows significant improvement in preventing data breaches, denial of service (DoS), and malware detection. A distinctive computational methodology to determine the cyber risk for industrial structures with IoT-explicit control factors has been programmed and elucidated in the perspective of IIoT systems. Firmware driven emulation (integrated and optimized) outcome aided to reduce breach ratio, better incident detection, and enhanced protection of confidential data.},

abstract={The cyber security exposure of resilient systems is frequently described as an attack surface. A larger surface area indicates increased exposure to threats and a higher risk of compromise. Ad-hoc addition of dynamic proactive defenses to distributed systems may inadvertently increase the attack surface. This can lead to cyber friendly fire, a condition in which adding superfluous or incorrectly configured cyber defenses unintentionally reduces security and harms mission effectiveness. Examples of cyber friendly fire include defenses which themselves expose vulnerabilities (e.g., through an unsecured admin tool), unknown interaction effects between existing and new defenses causing brittleness or unavailability, and new defenses which may provide security benefits, but cause a significant performance impact leading to mission failure through timeliness violations. This paper describes a prototype service capability for creating semantic models of attack surfaces and using those models to (1) automatically quantify and compare cost and security metrics across multiple surfaces, covering both system and defense aspects, and (2) automatically identify opportunities for minimizing attack surfaces, e.g., by removing interactions that are not required for successful mission execution.},

abstract={Information in mobile devices is an asset like other important business assets, is essential to an organization's business and consequently needs to be suitably protected. The use of mobile devices involves the sharing of its functions between the official and personal use of the data in the same device. The organization needs to perform a risk assessment in order to determine the organization's mobile devices exposure to risk and determine the best way to manage this. The determination of risk within the methodology is based upon the standard formula, which the risk is calculated from the multiplication of the asset value, threats and vulnerability. The ISO 27001 requires is that `An appropriate risk assessment shall be undertaken'. The purpose of this study is to introduce enhancement ways to measure the value of a mobile device using ISO 27001 assets management methodology and mobile device categorization methodology.},

abstract={Due to the characteristics and connectivity of today's Cyber-Physical Control Systems (CPCS) and critical infrastructures, cyber-attacks on these systems are currently difficult to prevent in an efficient and sustainable manner. Prevention and mitigation need accurate identification and evaluation of: system vulnerabilities, likely threats and attacks, and applicable hardening measures. Furthermore, the ability to prioritize hardening measures based on accurate assessments of threat risk and consequence and mitigation availability, applicability, and cost is also needed. To address this challenge we created HESTIA: High-level and Extensible System for Training and Infrastructure risk Assessment. In this paper, we describe the latest architecture and working principles of HESTIA. When fully developed, the HESTIA process and tool-set will enable CPCS engineers to, iteratively: 1) specify a CPCS, 2) select applicable attacks and hardening measures from a library, 3) check specifications for consistency and applicability, and 4) merge attack and hardening specifications into a new CPCS model. In addition, we add support for device specification templates. HESTIA enables the discovery of attack-defend scenarios through simulation and the design of optimal hardening strategies for a given CPCS. This paper is a shortened and updated version of a journal article entitled An architecture for HESTIA to appear in the International Journal of Internet of Things and Cyber-Assurance.},

abstract={This paper argues that cyber-attacks are increasingly being seen as a threat to maritime situational awareness in the Asia Pacific region, and highlights how the Japanese and Taiwanese governments have been developing both offensive and defensive cyber operations to ameliorate vulnerabilities in their naval fleets vis-a-vis their respective relationships with China. The paper begins by exploring traditional understandings of maritime situational awareness and how changes in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have transformed the maritime strategic environment in recent decades. The paper moves on to explore how countries in the region, including China, the US, Japan and Taiwan are developing new capabilities in this area and new military doctrine to avoid disruptions to maritime operations. The final section of the paper presents a forward looking analysis of how cyber-attacks could affect military responses to territorial dispute in the South China Sea in particular, and the normative dangers of cyber militarization in the naval domain. The paper is based on field research conducted in Japan and Taiwan in 2014/15.},

abstract={In the wake of recent events, network security and reliability have become top issues for service providers and enterprises. The worldwide cost of cyber attacks is estimated to have been in the $145 billion dollar range for 2003. 2003 was also regarded as the "worst year ever" for computer viruses and worms; in 2001 the Code Red worm took several days to create widespread damage, whereas Slammer in 2003 had significant impact in just minutes. Over 90% of network attacks resulting in significant financial loss originate from inside a network's perimeter. Unfortunately, there appears to be no end in sight to these threats to network security; in fact, there is an increasing trend of attacking financial resources in addition to computing resources. The newly ratified ITU-T Recommendation X.805 "security architecture for systems providing end-to-end communications" was developed as the framework for the architecture and dimensions in achieving end-to-end security of distributed applications. It provides a comprehensive, multilayered, end-to-end network security framework across eight security dimensions in order to combat network security threats. We introduce the X.805 standard and describe how it can be applied to all phases of a network security program. We also provide examples of the business impact of network security vulnerabilities and the application of X.805 for network security assessments. Enterprises and service providers alike should use X.805 to provide a rigorous approach to network security throughout the entire lifecycle of their security programs.},

abstract={The use of information is inextricably linked with its security. The presence of vulnerabilities enables a third party to breach the security of information. Threat modeling helps to identify those infrastructure areas, which would be most likely exposed to attacks. In some cases, threat modeling cannot be classified as sufficient protection method. This paper entitled "Formalization of attack prediction problem" presents an analysis of different techniques with an attempt to identify the most informative parameters and attack prediction markers, which would lay the foundation for the development of attack probability functions. The obtained functional dependencies should be formally verified for further testing by a real system. The findings of this research could be applied during the future assessment of information system risk levels to ensure more effective information security management.},

abstract={With the surge in data-intensive science applications, the campus cloud infrastructures are increasingly dealing with sensitive data that has strict security requirements. However, in most cases due to lack of sophisticated security frameworks and trained personnel, such campus private clouds (CPC) are not fully equipped to handle sophisticated integrity, availability, and confidentiality attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of a cost-effective, and implementationally simpler Moving Target Defense (MTD) based cloud resource adaptation approach that significantly reduces the probability of attack success. In particular, we propose a Bayesian Attack Graph (BAG) based threat assessment model. Our proposed model follows Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) impact evaluation recommendations. As a case study, We use our graph based threat assessment model to demonstrate the utility of MTD against attacks on City University of New York (CUNY) research network. The study involves unique scenarios with multiple confidentiality, integrity, and availability related vulnerabilities being exploited by attacks from different network locations. Finally, we simulate a CUNY research network in GENI environment to validate our BAG model by emulating attack scenarios and observing system resilience with and without MTD.},

abstract={SCADA systems are broadly employed in supervising and controlling industrial areas comprising manufacturing industries, traffic control, power plants, integrated water management systems (distribution, treatment and sewage). The security of SCADA systems represents a significant subject on account of the critical function that these systems perform in offering vital utility services. In nowadays industrial systems ubiquitous access to Internet enhance the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems, for the reason that this allows a remote attacker to obtain control of, or produce interruption to the network critical functions. The attacks affect the network control plane and /or the data plane. Critical infrastructures, requiring uninterrupted operation, maintenance, and protection, have need of robust and secured control SCADA systems. The paper intends to depicts the critical architectural constituents of these systems, detect vulnerabilities and possible threats, and illustrate protection techniques that may be set up in order to reduce attacks involving situation awareness solutions.},

One key element in the risk assessment process is the determination of the probability of occurrence of elementary attack actions. For that, this paper suggests a novel model which considers vulnerability severities, attack scenarios and various potential actors and their motivations. Based on the results obtained from the new model we further infer the most likely attack scenarios.

abstract={The purpose of this article is to introduce a risk analysis framework to enhance the cyber security of and to protect the critical infrastructure of the electric power grid of the United States. Building on the fundamental questions of risk assessment and management, this framework aims to advance the current risk analysis discussions pertaining to the electric power grid. Most of the previous risk-related studies on the electric power grid focus mainly on the recovery of the network from hurricanes and other natural disasters. In contrast, a disproportionately small number of studies explicitly investigate the vulnerability of the electric power grid to cyber-attack scenarios, and how they could be prevented or mitigated. Such a limited approach leaves the United States vulnerable to foreign and domestic threats (both state-sponsored and “lone wolf”) to infiltrate a network that lacks a comprehensive security environment or coordinated government response. By conducting a review of the literature and presenting a risk-based framework, this article underscores the need for a coordinated United States cyber security effort toward formulating strategies and responses conducive to protecting the nation against attacks on the electric power grid.},

abstract={DNA fingerprinting can offer remarkable benefits, especially for point-of-care diagnostics, information forensics, and analysis. However, the pressure to drive down costs is likely to lead to cheap untrusted solutions and a multitude of unprecedented risks. These risks will especially emerge at the frontier between the cyberspace and DNA biology. To address these risks, we perform a forensic-security assessment of a typical DNA-fingerprinting flow. We demonstrate, for the first time, benchtop analysis of biochemical-level vulnerabilities in flows that are based on a standard quantification assay known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After identifying potential vulnerabilities, we realize attacks using benchtop techniques to demonstrate their catastrophic impact on the outcome of the DNA fingerprinting. We also propose a countermeasure, in which DNA samples are each uniquely barcoded (using synthesized DNA molecules) in advance of PCR analysis, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our approach using benchtop techniques. We discuss how molecular barcoding could be utilized within a cyber-biological framework to improve DNA-fingerprinting security against a wide range of threats, including sample forgery. We also present a security analysis of the DNA barcoding mechanism from a molecular biology perspective.},

abstract={In recent years, the growing emergence of digitalization and data explosion has altered the threat dynamics in the maritime sector. The interconnected Maritime Critical Infrastructures are highly attracted by cybercriminals, who are constantly evolving their tactics, committing complex, sophisticated attacks causing a tremendous impact to economic and social life. Such intrusions engage multi-vector, composite attacks exploiting existing vulnerabilities from both the physical and the cyber domain. Current risk assessment approaches and countermeasure strategies fail to gather an overview of the maritime physical and cyber threat landscape. This work describes a method to detect and counter such sophisticated attacks by applying a Hybrid Situational Awareness model. This model allows to generate a holistic picture of the security condition within Maritime Critical Infrastructures considering the potential cascading effects of such combined cyberphysical attacks. Furthermore, the current work presents some illustrative examples, which show how the Hybrid Situational Awareness model can be integrated into maritime environments to detect potential future coordinated attacks and how it can facilitate the communication with first responders and emergency organizations of a city in case of a crisis.},

abstract={Considering the increasing deployment of the Internet and information systems together with providing various services through web applications, the related risks and threats in this field are also skyrocketing. In recent years several different websites such as online shops, portals, and governmental sites were subject to penetrations attacks and illegal hacking activities. The mentioned intrusions have often resulted in significant financial and credibility losses together with endangering organizational and even national interests. Given the magnitude and complexity of cyber-attacks and due to the diversity of the web application's structure, the need to have a comprehensive and effective solution to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of such attacks is imperative. Taking into account the nature of the Internet and the necessity of websites availability 24 hours a day from all parts of the globe, it is ideal and can be taken as an advantage, but it should be also noted that this feature, considering the absence of appropriate security, can lead to some main ways for targeting and attacking web applications. One of the newest tools to prevent infiltration and attacks on websites, are web application-specific firewalls or the Web Application Firewalls (WAF) by which security policies can be applied among end users and web applications. In this paper this feature has been implemented in software for protection and provides the advantage of preserving the security in web applications against attacks and methods which affect the system together through a comparative approach.},

abstract={The Internet is an open networked system containing much inherent vulnerability, especially around the implementation and management of the services that run there. Application owners and service providers require automated deployment time security in order to protect the services that will be exposed to public and private networks. At the moment, manual intervention is required causing a period of vulnerability to these exposed services. The topic of the paper is how better to address this vulnerable period with automated solutions. We want cloud deployments to be secure from cyber attack as quickly as possible during the transition from deployment to a runtime environment without the need for manual intervention. Commonly, current practice involves making services live and undertaken reactive security measures manually, resulting in costly cyber security breaches. There is an identifiable cyber security issue highlighting the lack of deployment time security automation. The problem is addressed, solvable and we suggest a potential solution. A solution is proposed and claimed as the most effective approach in comparison to other options. This entails implementing all required security measures to an application and its container in an automated way at the point of deployment. The contribution of the paper therefore is to identify how today's cyber threats are potentially serious in particular to newly deployed applications in a cloud space. Subsequently, an elegant solution is put forward involving automated techniques to protect an application both inside and outside the application container. The solution consists of a vulnerability assessment of the system containing the application, the creation of an automatic firewall perimeter and automatically patching applications against vulnerabilities. This is an approach based on prevention rather than detection.},

abstract={Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been encouraged to take advantage of any possible business opportunities by utilizing and adopting new-technologies such as cloud computing services, there is a huge misunderstanding of their cyber threats from the management perspective. Underestimation of cybersecurity threats by SMEs leads to an increase in their vulnerabilities and risks, which unfortunately can become actual challenges to them and other related parties. The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review based on recently available evidence on cybersecurity risk management in SMEs in order to understand the current situation. The authors aim to reveal the role the SMEs' management is playing in addressing cybersecurityrisks in recent years, as found in the literature, and to suggest avenues for further research. The paper follows a well-known method for conducting a systematic literature review. Starting with a keyword search and an assessment of fitness for this review, 15 papers out of 50 have been analysed by NVivo software according to bibliographical information, research design and findings. The review identified 5 major perspectives that play a key role in SMEs' cybersecurity risk management, which are threats, behaviours, practices, awareness, and decision-making respectively. Importantly, empirical research on cybersecurity risk management in SMEs is needed.},

abstract={Energy efficiency, noise and emissions footprint reduction are major “green” performance targets of next-generation air transportation systems. Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is an advanced “cyber-physical” concept that can help meet such targets by enabling highly accurate air traffic surveillance. However, beneficial, confident application of ADS-B requires a foundational understanding of vulnerabilities and mitigation requirements. This paper focuses on the assessment and mitigation of threats from unauthorized access and unanticipated disruption of ADS-B communications. We present a solution to protect message integrity in ADS-B IN based airborne surveillance, discuss the accuracy and robustness of the solution in the presence of spoofed or compromised nodes and intentional jamming. To study effects of “intelligent jamming” strategies on ADS-B, visualize and analyze system-wide impact, we propose a security simulation tool concept and design.},

abstract={The rapid evolution of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services transforms the conventional electrical grid into a new paradigm called Smart Grid (SG). Even though SG brings significant improvements, such as increased reliability and better energy management, it also introduces multiple security challenges. One of the main reasons for this is that SG combines a wide range of heterogeneous technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The latter are responsible for monitoring and controlling the automatic procedures of energy transmission and distribution. Nevertheless, the presence of these systems introduces multiple vulnerabilities because their protocols do not implement essential security mechanisms such as authentication and access control. In this paper, we focus our attention on the security issues of the IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC-104) protocol, which is widely utilized in the European energy sector. In particular, we provide a SCADA threat model based on a Coloured Petri Net (CPN) and emulate four different types of cyber attacks against IEC-104. Last, we used AlienVault's risk assessment model to evaluate the risk level that each of these cyber attacks introduces to our system to confirm our intuition about their severity.},

abstract={The integration of cyberspace and space systems development and operations activities has become essential to the successful achievement of Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Net-Centric mission requirements. In general, approaches to Air Force risk management and cybersecurity have focused largely on the implementation of technology as reactive mechanisms in the operational environment. The importance of proactively addressing the risks associated with space/cyberspace integration at any point in the system development lifecycle (SDLC) and iteratively re-addressing those risks throughout the SDLC has become even greater in the face of continually evolving cyberspace threats. In response to this situation, an approach to threat and vulnerability assessments has been developed to conduct risk identification, analysis, handling, and monitoring iteratively throughout the SDLC for the Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Systems Wing (MCSW) portfolio of programs. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Terminal Engineering Office (JTEO) emphasizes proactive end to end terminal engineering analysis that is critical to the success of terminal acquisition programs (systems development) and the operational (warfighter) mission. This paper presents the JTEO's approach to addressing cyber-based threats and vulnerabilities to MILSATCOM systems, architectures, and Joint terminal development that integrates both qualitative and quantitative engineering analyses for improved decision-making regarding the effectiveness of and return on investment (ROI) from terminal requirements. The JTEO approach to threat, vulnerability and risk assessment adapts MCSW and AFSPC enterprise risk management strategies by identifying cyberspace threats to the terminal segment and supporting the mitigation of those threats during systems engineering, development, systems integration, test and evaluation, and information assurance (IA) certification and accreditation (C&A) and supplying the results of those efforts to the enterprise. The JTEO cybersecurity initiatives support the terminal C&A process and can also support the process by which terminals may gain approval to connect to MILSATCOM systems, and potentially, through those MILSATCOM systems, to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN)/Global Information Grid (GIG).},

abstract={As electrical power operations tend to be smart grid with strong penetration of renewable energy resources, the evolution of operational technology brings on board another dimension of vulnerabilities with the participation of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Thus, it becomes essential to perform technical risk assessment and CPS prognosis to envisage the integrity of the system's operational resilience. The communication network elements such as cyber signal transmission, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the internet of things (IoTs) converges as a superhighway hub. This seeks to improve on network operations for efficient power delivery of distributed energy resources (DERs) integration grid. It then demands system configuration to be firewalled to avoid operational intrusions and malfunctions. The paper examines the technical threats involved in the paradigm of schemes and mitigation strategies. The areas of study are the vulnerabilities of the DERs integration with CPS, WSNs and IoTs layers. The risk aversion strategies of DERs integration with CPS are also discussed. The study aims to ascertain the intrusion level and responses of the integrated DERs grid in terms of power management. The paper's objective is to present an overview of current developments in the integrated cyber-power systems evolution and the implementation strategies with DERs.},

Additionally, this research analyzes Online Banking security practices that can be a backdoor for serious incidents and highlights risk management process. The goal is to provide a review of major risks including security risks, compliance risk and operational risk that have been developed in online banking. Also, the study reviews threat methodologies that attacker has been followed in recent years. As a result, the research shows that most dangerous attacks came particularly from one vulnerability that was disregard and handled without appropriate strategies; and provides guidance on risk monitoring and assessment in Online systems.},

abstract={The smart grid, generally referred to as the next generation power electric system, relies on robust information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide efficient, secure, and reliable information delivery. The implementation of the smart grid includes the deployment of multiple new infrastructures with vulnerabilities that have not yet been identified. Therefore, the traditional focus on security, reliability, compliance, and human safety is a paramount concern. This paper first addresses critical issues of smart grid primarily in terms of ICTs and standards. A risk-based approach has been presented, which could be implemented to address the security aspects and health impact of the smart grid. The paper evaluates the security threats to the smart grid as well as the health risks of smart meters currently under implementation in the context of radio frequency (RF) radiation. Finally, a combined framework for risk management in major technological and health domains has been proposed. Such a framework calls for a coordinated assessment of cyber and power grid risks keeping the whole grid security and safety goals in mind.},

abstract={Risk management is widely used in order to evaluate and treat prominent risks for organizations. Such models are rather organizational (business-aware) than technical, and enable security officers to manage risks on the long run. However, both ICT systems and threat landscape do not cease to evolve, and dynamic cyber security management becomes paramount to address potential breaches. The operational security management is based on technical processes, executed by administrators who are not necessarily aware of organization's business and strategic aspects. This gap between technical and organizational levels renders traditional risks assessment methods cumbersome and obsolete. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of Elementary Risk (ER) that represents a quantum of risk for an organization. Composite Risks (CRs) are then calculated and presented for the security officer. CR enables dynamic calculation of organizational risk posture while considering the system's state. Moreover, ER and CR enable capture the contribution of technical elements (e.g. vulnerability, server) or security measures (e.g. patch, firewall rule) to the overall risk profile of the organization.},

abstract={Accurate measurement of the quality of systems is crucial to building trustworthy systems. Such a measurement indicates whether a system is working properly and meeting its requirements. Although security and dependability metrics are regarded as key metrics for measuring the quality of systems, they are not sufficient for measuring the quality of systems that are placed in a multi-domain environment including hardware, software, network, human factors, and physical environments. In order to embrace multidimensional aspects of the quality of a system, we introduce a trustworthiness metric framework that supports three key submetrics of trust, resilience, and agility, and propose an ontology-based framework with three corresponding sub-ontologies. We also discuss how the key metrics are related to the severity of threats and the quality of assessment tools. This work is part of the cyber defense effort conducted by the Trustworthy Systems Working Group (TSWG) under the Cyber Strategic Challenge Group (CSCG) of The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP), which is an international cooperation organization for enhancing defense science and technology.},

This paper summarizes various academic and industrial views on the topic of cyber red teaming and aims at clarifying the common properties that differentiate it from other types of security assessments and real attackers. Based on evidence from case studies and various expert opinions, we have concluded that red teaming is a distinct type of security assessment, and that penetration tests are often mislabeled as red team engagements.},

abstract={Threat assessment of systems is critical to organizations' security policy. Identifying systems likely to be at-risk by threat actors can help organizations better defend against likely cyber attacks. Currently, identifying such systems to a large extent is guided by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Previous research has demonstrated poor correlation between a high CVSS score and at-risk systems. In this paper, we look at hacker discussions on darkweb marketplaces and forums to identify the platforms, vendors, and products likely to be at-risk by hackers. We propose a reasoning system that combines DeLP (Defeasible Logic Programming) and machine learning classifiers to identify systems based on hacker discussions observed on the darkweb. The resulting system is therefore a hybrid between classical knowledge representation and reasoning techniques and machine learning classifiers. We evaluate the system on hacker discussions collected from nearly 300 darkweb forums and marketplaces provided by a threat intelligence company. We improved precision by 15%-57% while maintaining recall over baseline approaches.},

abstract={Cyber threats are serious concerns for power systems. For example, hackers may attack power control systems via interconnected enterprise networks. This paper proposes a risk assessment framework to enhance the resilience of power systems against cyber attacks. The duality element relative fuzzy evaluation method is employed to evaluate identified security vulnerabilities within cyber systems of power systems quantitatively. The attack graph is used to identify possible intrusion scenarios that exploit multiple vulnerabilities. An intrusion response system (IRS) is developed to monitor the impact of intrusion scenarios on power system dynamics in real time. IRS calculates the conditional Lyapunov exponents (CLEs) on line based on the phasor measurement unit data. Power system stability is predicted through the values of CLEs. Control actions based on CLEs will be suggested if power system instability is likely to happen. A generic wind farm control system is used for case study. The effectiveness of IRS is illustrated with the IEEE 39 bus system model.},

abstract={This paper develops a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of cyber security breach reporting laws across states. In doing so, trends and correlations in state reporting along with other relevant factors are identified using readily available data. This paper addresses two critical questions in the assessment of breach reporting legislation: 1) How does the rate of reporting security breaches across states compare with the rate of reporting of security threats to computer operating systems?, and 2) What factors other than the implementation of breach reporting legislation effect the rate of reporting security breaches across states? The framework developed in this paper can be applied in future analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of breach reporting legislation and can assist in pinpointing legislative weaknesses across states. Limitations in the availability of data inspired the generation of a number of recommendations for the improvement of breach reporting law evaluation. First, more time is needed to collect data, as most laws have been in place for two or fewer years. Second, each state should have a central database that records all reported cyber security breaches. This will allow for greater visibility to the public and would make for greater accessibility of data for both consumers and researchers. Finally, further research efforts should be conducted on the topic of OS security vulnerability patch rates and their relevance to the actual, realized cyber threat level of operating systems.},

abstract={The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) is rapidly increasing in electric power systems (EPS). While the inclusion of intermittent RES coupled with the wide-scale deployment of communication and sensing devices is important towards a fully smart grid, it has also expanded the cyber-threat landscape, effectively making power systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This paper proposes a cybersecurity assessment approach designed to assess the cyberphysical security of EPS. The work takes into consideration the intermittent generation of RES, vulnerabilities introduced by microprocessor-based electronic information and operational technology (IT/OT) devices, and contingency analysis results. The proposed approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an adapted Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score tailored to assess vulnerabilities in EPS in order to identify the optimal attack transition policy based on N-2 contingency results, i.e., the simultaneous failure of two system elements. The effectiveness of the work is validated via numerical and real-time simulation experiments performed on literature-based power grid test cases. The results demonstrate how the proposed method based on deep Q-network (DQN) performs closely to a graph-search approach in terms of the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack policy, without the need for full observation of the system. In addition, the experiments present the method’s scalability by showcasing the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack transition policy in a large system such as the Polish 2383 bus test system. The results exhibit how the proposed approach requires one order of magnitude fewer transitions when compared to a random transition policy.},

abstract={Most information attacks come from the Internet these days; they spread through networks of different types and extensions. The quantity of malware of a size of several hundred millions require more and more refined and complex solutions and tools of protection. The products sold as virus protection programs in the 80s have become complex systems by today. The situation is made even more difficult by the fact that the continually appearing threats are active for a very short time only-for 2-3 hours or a few days. The multilevel protection systems provide protection of the computers in diverse user situations. The continuous development and complexity of the operation systems, the applications running on them, the forms and possibilities of attacks taking advantage of them and the protection solutions result in the fact that the users of computers are not aware of what sources of danger are threatening their machines and what the protection systems are capable of and to what extent they can protect the IT systems from the attacks. The independent testers specialized in the investigation of protection systems assess the protection solutions only but they can hardly answer the question to what extent the set of the protection systems used by the user can protect the infrastructure of the user against cyber-attacks. In this paper the possibilities how antimalware testing industry can provide more valuable and usable information for the protection of IT infrastructures are discussed. In order to do this we need to rise above the assessment of the protection systems and examine the vulnerability and protection of an infrastructure.},

abstract={Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) are assets that provide core functions to modern society, which failure or incapacitation can adversely affect national security, economic prosperity and wellbeing of citizens. In an evolving digital society, CNI rely heavily on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure to improve productivity, and effectively deliver critical services in timely and cost-effective fashion. However, the underlying ICT infrastructure that drives CNI amplify cyber risks, threats and vulnerabilities exponentially. Consequently, a failure in ICT infrastructure has the potential to affect CNI in an unexpected manner. The risks associated with the use of ICT are dynamic, raising the need for continuous assessment of degree of ICT dependency. Presently however, there is rarely a framework nor a publicly available tool in Nigeria that can quantitatively gauge the degree of CNI dependency on ICT. The study addresses this gap by the development of a conceptual framework that can facilitate the assessment of the degree of CNI dependency on ICT. In this study, existing relevant documents on critical infrastructure, ICT frameworks and standards and critical process engineering principles were scanned, analysed and synthesised to conceptualise the framework, and the construction of the building blocks, metrics and indicators. The framework was tested using a hypothetical discrete dataset. The outcome further facilitated the framing of ICT Dependency Index (IDI), a predefined quadrant, of which the computation of Dependency must fall within one of the quadrants.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) are highly distributed information systems used to control and monitor critical infrastructures such as nuclear plants, power generation and distribution plants, Oil and Gas and many other facilities. The main architecture principles of ICS are; real time response, high availability and reliability. For these specific purposes, several protocols has been designed to ensure the control and supervision operations. Modbus and DNP3 are the most used protocols in the ICS world due to their compliance with real time needs. With the increasing of the connectivity to the internet world for business reasons, ICS adopted Internet based technologies and most of communication protocols are redesigned to work over IP. This openness exposed the ICS components as well as communication protocols to cyber-attacks with a higher risk than attacks on traditional IT systems. In order to facilitate the risk assessment of cyber-attacks on ICS protocols we propose a taxonomy model of different identified attacks on Modbus and DNP3.the model is based on the threat origin, threat type, attack type, attack scenario, vulnerability type and the impact of the attack. We populate this Taxonomy model with identified attacks on Modbus and DNP3 from previous academic and industrial works.},

abstract={In the United States alone well over a million organizations have become so dependent on cyberspace that their vital interests are now vulnerable to attack, accidents, and design failures that may compromise those interests. Many experts believe the situation is getting worse; that new vulnerabilities are being pumped into cyberspace, and that the bad guys are coming up with more sophisticated and scalable attacks faster than the good guys are coming up with improved defenses. The technical R&D pipelines do not show much promise for generating solutions that will provide discernable, measureable, readily and massively scalable improvements in cyber security for enormous populations of users. Nor is there much expectation that a broadly operational engineering science of cyber security, nor a set of voluntary standards and calls for information sharing, nor a set of government laws and enforcing institutions, will achieve this end any time soon. Cyberspace is thus an environment where all dependent organizations are vulnerable and at risk. Even NSA admits to its inability to guarantee its own information security. But not all users are equally vulnerable. There are a multitude of products, procedures, standards, and policies that, if appropriately used, can make some users safer and more secure than others in cyberspace. But it takes knowledgeable people to bring these possibilities to bear, and to sustain and update their use. However, many organizations cannot or will not invest in many or any full time cyber security employees. Since millions of organizations worldwide are largely responsible for their own cyber security, this implies a huge workforce need and shortfall. Many organizations may be dependent on personnel who are not full time cyber security professionals to perform security functions or to be able and knowledgeable enough to obtain needed training, products, and services from outside their organizations. A premise of this presentation is that the primary bearer of risk when things go wrong in cyberspace is the organization that has become so dependent on computer-communications systems, not the hardware and software in the computer-communications systems. There are an enormous number and variety of such organizations in national, state, and local governments, in the business and educational sectors, and arguably has come to include most of the organizations that have a payroll, engage in on-line transactions, have their intellectual property and other vital information on computers, or are otherwise strongly reliant on their presence on the worldwide web. They have many different forms of dependencies and risk tolerances. Their customers and the users of their products and services make up extended organizations of dependencies and risk. It will be useful to distinguish need, demand, and supply in the context of the cyber security workforce. Following [NRC 2013]: “Need is the number (and skill mix) of cybersecurity workers that are required to provide satisfactory cybersecurity (a judgment that will vary according to who makes the assessment). Demand is expressed by the desired capabilities stated in job descriptions, the number of such positions that are created and filled, and the salaries offered to those who have those abilities. Demand will fall short of national or societal need to the extent that cybersecurity is a public good - that is, organizations will invest to meet their own requirements but not necessarily to achieve societally desirable overall requirements. Demand can also fall short of an organization's own needs if (1) the organization lacks the required resources or (2) an organization underestimates the threats it faces. Supply is the number of available qualified workers willing to fill positions, and is a function of the visibility and attractiveness of cybersecurity occupations, the availability of appropriate training and education, and (as in all fields) the overall labor market in which potential workers respond to salary and other signals about demand.”},

In the United States alone, well over a million organizations have become so dependent on cyberspace that their vital interests are now vulnerable to attack, accidents and design failures that may compromise those interests. Many experts believe the situation is getting worse; that new vulnerabilities are being pumped into cyberspace, and that the bad guys are coming up with more sophisticated and scalable attacks faster than the good guys are coming up with improved defenses. The technical R&D pipelines do not show much promise for generating solutions that will provide discernable, measureable, readily and massively scalable improvements in cyber security for enormous populations of users. Nor is there much expectation that a broadly operational engineering science of cyber security, nor a set of voluntary standards and calls for information sharing, nor a set of government laws and enforcing institutions, will achieve this end any time soon. Cyberspace is thus an environment where all dependent organizations are vulnerable and at risk. Even NSA admits to its inability to guarantee its own information security. But not all users are equally vulnerable. There are a multitude of products, procedures, standards, and policies that, if appropriately used, can make some users safer and more secure than others in cyberspace. But it takes knowledgeable people to bring these possibilities to bear, and to sustain and update their use. However, many organizations cannot or will not invest in many or any full time cyber security employees. Since millions of organizations worldwide are largely responsible for their own cyber security, this implies a huge workforce need and shortfall. Many organizations may be dependent on personnel who are not full time cyber security professionals to perform security functions or to be able and knowledgeable enough to obtain needed training, products, and services from outside their organizations. A premise of this presentation is that the primary bearer of risk when things go wrong in cyberspace is the organization that has become so dependent on computer-communications systems, not the hardware and software in the computer-communications systems. There are an enormous number and variety of such organizations in national, state, and local governments, in the business and educational sectors, and arguably has come to include most of the organizations that have a payroll, engage in on-line transactions, have their intellectual property and other vital information on computers, or are otherwise strongly reliant on their presence on the worldwide web. They have many different forms of dependencies and risk tolerances. Their customers and the users of their products and services make up extended organizations of dependencies and risk. It will be useful to distinguish need, demand, and supply in the context of the cyber security workforce. Following [NRC 2013]: “Need is the number (and skill mix) of cybersecurity workers that are required to provide satisfactory cybersecurity (a judgment that will vary according to who makes the assessment). Demand is expressed by the desired capabilities stated in job descriptions, the number of such positions that are created and filled, and the salaries offered to those who have those abilities. Demand will fall short of national or societal need to the extent that cybersecurity is a public good - that is, organizations will invest to meet their own requirements but not necessarily to achieve societally desirable overall requirements. Demand can also fall short of an organization's own needs if (1) the organization lacks the required resources or (2) an organization underestimates the threats it faces. Supply is the number of available qualified workers willing to fill positions, and is a function of the visibility and attractiveness of cybersecurity occupations, the availability of appropriate training and education, and (as in all fields) the overall labor market in which potential workers respond to salary and other signals about demand”},
