abstract={As the Internet has become more and more popular, there are already over 2.3 billion people using Internet. However, the amount of available IPv4 addresses only has about 250 million. Although some solutions for saving the IPv4 shortage problem, like NAT or CIDR, were applied, the best way for solving the IPv4 shortage is using IPv6 addresses. Because the protocol between the IPv4 and IPv6 address is not compatible, the dual stack solution may be needed to support IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Hence, the organization facing the threats from both IPv4 and IPv6 networks will be a critical issue. In this paper, we proposed a light-weight penetration test tool for IPv6 threats to detect vulnerability in the network environment. In the proposed system, we first use common IPv6 attack tool to generate IPv6 attack signatures to attack a virtual victim. A sniffer will be used to observe network package to check whether it meets pre-defined signatures. The proposed system will generate a report to tell network administrators if the IPv6 network is vulnerable or not.},

abstract={Evolving technology has created an inevitable threat of expose of data that is shared online. Wireshark tool enables the ethical hacker to reveal the flaws in the system security at the user authentication level. This approach of identifying vulnerabilities is deemed fit as the strategy involved in this testing is rapid and provides good success in identifying vulnerabilities. The usage of Wireshark also ensures that the procedure followed is up to the required standards. This paper discussed about the need to utilize penetration testing, the benefits of using Wireshark for the same and goes on to illustrate one method of using the tool to perform penetration testing. Most areas of a network are highly susceptible to security attacks by adversaries. This paper focuses on solving the aforementioned issue by surveying various tools available for penetration testing.

abstract={Smart Cities have been facing a lot of security breach issues, there are many risks that have high impacts on its sustainability. Penetration testing is an essential assessment and needs to be performed frequently for Smart Cities systems to maintain their safety and security. Due to the rapid growth of modern cities, there is an exigent need to identify the various security risks and threats that exists in these cities. This study proposes a practical and efficient solution to mitigate these risks by evaluating a smart solution in performing penetration testing on those smart cities via using a Raspberry Pi III-computer based smart device as an alternative method to perform penetration testing. Raspberry Pi III is a portable device which has a self-contained miniaturized computer that can be used to perform some tasks such as penetration and vulnerability assessments to identify and scan the networks by using some build-in pentesting tools. This research paper discussed the benefits of using such smart device in performing penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.},

abstract={Cyber-attacks against companies and governments are increasing in complexity, persistence and numbers. Common intrusion detection methods lack the ability to detect such - what are commonly termed - advanced persistent threats. A new approach is needed that takes the stepwise characteristics of this type of threats into account and links analysis methods to attack features. This paper takes up this challenge. First, an analysis framework is proposed to relate complex attack attributes to detection and business aspects. Second, the framework is used to define a development roadmap for designing advanced intrusion detection systems, such systems can analyze network traffic and client data at multiple network locations using both signature and anomaly detection methods derived from the intelligent data analysis field. Third, a test case is provided showing the potential power of the proposed development roadmap.},

abstract={Computer networks threats are becoming one the most widely debated issues worldwide. Various types of attacks are generated periodically and in an increasing scale alarming and threatening networking security issues. This is leading tone serious and fast development of feasible techniques for developing effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS's). In this context, some of the widely used and tested IDS's are discussed. Anomaly-based network intrusion detection techniques are getting the attention in most of the networking fields to protect network systems against malicious acts, providing a good security level especially with the integration of neural networks in the detection systems which provided advanced methods of threats investigation and detection. This paper emphasizes the importance of anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques, the important outcomes of these systems, latest developed methods and what is expected from the future experiments in this field. Moreover, the technique of learning user profiles effects in detecting intrusions will be discussed.

abstract={In today's era security in network is becoming weak due to increase in number of viruses and threats. These viruses and threats are becoming stronger and stronger due to automatic tools that are coming to the market. These tools without any knowledge of coding can create harmful viruses and threats which are really hard to control. Though we have latest tools to overcome against these threats but still we cannot think that we are safe completely. So, in this paper we have proposed our own Intrusion detection system with component based software Engineering approach along with the clean room software engineering approach in which we test our component at every stage of development of a component that is during its build so that we get minimum chances of bug in our Intrusion Detection System.

abstract={A modern vehicle is a complex system of sensors, electronic control units, and actuators connected through different types of intra-vehicle networks to control and monitor the state of the vehicle. In addition, modern vehicles are becoming increasingly connected to the outside world through V2X technologies. However, these provide new attack surfaces that increase the cybersecurity risk to modern vehicles. To this end, there are two distinct and key challenges that need to be addressed to ensure safety and consumer trust. While modern vehicles must be equipped with the best countermeasures against cybersecurity threats, a reliable mechanism shall be also in place to detect the potential intrusions of the system while in operation, which is termed as intrusion detection. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive review of the state of the art of the intra-vehicle intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for passenger vehicles. We first provide an overview of intra-vehicle networks before reviewing contemporary research in intra-vehicle IDSs. The approach employed is to categorize the reviewed works based on their detection technique and to examine the used feature and feature selection methods, evaluation dataset, attack type, performance metrics, and benchmark models. This paper also presents outstanding research challenges and gaps in intra-vehicle IDS research.},

abstract={Insider threats are evolving constantly and misuse the granted resource access for various malicious activities. These insider threats make use of internal network flaws as the loop holes and are the root cause for data exfiltration and infiltration (Data leakage). Organizations are devising and deploying new solutions for analyzing, monitoring and predicting these insider threats. However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem. The objective of this research is to develop a Complex Event Processing (CEP) based Hybrid IDS that integrates the output of the Host IDS and Network IDS into the CEP Module and produces a consolidated output with higher accuracy. The overall deployment protects the internal information system without any data leakage by Stateful Packet Inspection. Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) is used to estimate and characterize the normal behavior of the network and send the values to the CEP Engine which alerts in case of any deviation from the normal pattern. The performance of the proposed Hybrid IDS is examined using test bed with normal and various attack scenarios.},

abstract={Web application security is a threat to the world's information technology infrastructure. The most widely used accepted solution to this threat is to deploy an Intrusion Detection System(IDS). Such systems currently rely on either signature of the attack or changes in the behavior patterns of the system to identify an intruder. These systems, either signature-based or anomaly-based, are readily understood by attackers. Problem occurs when attacks are not detected by the existing IDS because the attack does not fit the pre-defined attack signatures. This work intends to address this problem. In this paper, we implemented two IDS model which includes an anomaly detection technique measured by cross entropy and a signature-based attack detection using genetic algorithm. Both the methods, that is signature based as well as anomaly based IDS are used to detect even more attacks than either approach could detect alone. By compiling each of the approaches, additional false positive and false negative attacks can be discovered as well. Those included in this work are SQL injection, cross-site scripting and remote file inclusion.},

abstract={Intrusion detection is one of the most challenging tasks and of highest priority in the cyber security field; however, traditional intrusion detection techniques often fail to handle the complex and uncertain network attack correlation tasks. We propose the usage of semantic networks that build relationships among network attacks and assist in automatically identifying and predicting related attacks. Also, our method can increase the precision in detecting probable attacks. Experimental results show that our Semantic Network using the Anderberg similarity measure performs better in terms of precision and recall compared to existing correlation approaches in the cyber security domain. Specifically, our contributions are as follows: (1) We automatically construct a first mode Semantic Network from characterizing features of network attacks using similarity. (2) The first mode semantic network is calibrated by adding external semantic rules provided by domain experts, in order to generate a more adaptable second mode semantic network. (3) We evaluated the prediction capability of the semantic networks by experimenting with various similarity measures including Anderberg, Jaccard, Simple Matching and traditional correlation coefficients; we discovered that the “Anderberg” similarity coefficients outperform all other tested similarity measures in terms of precision and recall.},

abstract={Big data platforms like Hadoop and Spark are being widely adopted both by academia and industry. In this paper, we propose a runtime intrusion detection technique that understands and works according to the memory properties of such distributed compute platforms. The proposed method is based on runtime analysis of memory access patterns of tasks running on the slave nodes of a distributed compute cluster. First, every slave node of the cluster creates a behavior profile for each task it executes. A behavior profile includes information representing the sizes of private & shared memory accesses made by a task during execution. Then, each process behavior profile is shared with other replica nodes that are scheduled to execute the same task on their copy of the same data. Next, these replica nodes verify their local tasks with the help of the information embedded in the received behavior profiles. This step is realized by running Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the memory access patterns. Finally, nodes share their observations for consensus and report a possible intrusion to the master node if they find any discrepancy. This is a position paper and hence the proposed solution was tested and proved to work in real-time while executing the terasort mapreduce example on a small hadoop cluster.},

Reliable benchmark datasets are critical to test and evaluate the performance of a detection system.

Conventional network intrusion detection systems and firewalls are usually preconfigured to detect this kind of malicious network scans. Now-a-days attackers have become smarter and can try avoiding common detection rules. There are a few targeted areas where Artificial Intelligence will deliver the greatest evolution for Cybersecurity. To build proactive defenses, the system has to understand the intelligence of threats that are currently targeting the organization. The implementation of machine learning and Threat intelligent-based solutions into the mix can revolutionize the landscape in cybersecurity industry against those kinds of network attacks.

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques provide many intelligent methods for security solutions in various domains such as finance, networking, cloud computing, health records and individual's identity. AI achieves security mechanisms like antivirus, firewalls, intrusion detection system (IDS) and cryptography by using machine learning methods and data analysis techniques. As the modern AI techniques help improving security systems, criminal activities are also becoming updated simultaneously. Machine learning methods along with data analysis tools have become popular to prevent security systems from threats and hacking activities. This work contributes to secure cloud networks and help them prevent malicious attacks. In this paper, Bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) is used to detect incidents over unified threat management (UTM) platform operated on cloud network. Results are compared with K-nearest neighbor which is a baseline technique. Time series input samples recorded over UTM platform are used for training and testing purposes. We obtain accuracy score of 98.47% with 0.0186 mean squared error (MSE) using KNN while BLSTM provides 98.6% accuracy score with 0.002 loss, which is better than the KNN.},

abstract={This paper proposes the use of an intrusion detection system (IDS) tailored to counter the threats to an IEC61850-automated substation based upon simulated attacks on intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). Intrusion detection (ID) is the process of detecting a malicious attacker. It is an effective and mature security mechanism. However, it is not harnessed when securing IEC61850-automated substations. The IDS of this paper is developed by using data collected by launching simulated attacks on IEDs and launching packet sniffing attacks using forged address resolution protocol (ARP) packets. The detection capability of the system is then tested by simulating attacks and through genuine user activity. A new method for evaluating the temporal risk of an intrusion for an electric substation based upon the statistical analysis of known attacks is also proposed.},

abstract={Information Security Assurance implies ensuring the integrity, confidentiality and availability of critical assets for an organization. The large amount of events to monitor in a fluid system in terms of topology and variety of new hardware or software, overwhelms monitoring controls. Furthermore, the multi-facets of cyber threats today makes it difficult even for security experts to handle and keep up-to-date. Hence, automatic "intelligent" tools are needed to address these issues. In this paper, we describe a `work in progress' contribution on intelligent based approach to mitigating security threats. The main contribution of this work is an anomaly based IDS model with active response that combines artificial immune systems and swarm intelligence with the SVM classifier. Test results for the NSL-KDD dataset prove the proposed approach can outperform the standard classifier in terms of attack detection rate and false alarm rate, while reducing the number of features in the dataset.},

abstract={Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the principle and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles. These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). VANETs add new threats to self-driving vehicles that contribute to substantial challenges in autonomous systems. These communication systems render self-driving vehicles vulnerable to many types of malicious attacks, such as Sybil attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), black hole, grey hole and wormhole attacks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars. The proposed scheme is based on Proportional Overlapping Score (POS) to decrease the number of features found in the Kyoto benchmark dataset. The hybrid detection system relies on the Back Propagation neural networks (BP), to detect a common type of attack in VANETs: Denial-of-Service (DoS). The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles.},

abstract={With thousands of alerts identified by IDSs every day, the process of distinguishing which alerts are important (i.e., true positives) and which are is irrelevant (i.e., false positives) is become more complicated. The security administrator must analyze each single alert either a true of false alert. This paper proposes an alert prioritization model, which is based on risk assessment. The model uses indicators, such as priority, reliability, asset value, as decision factors to calculate alert's risk. The objective is to determine the impact of certain alerts generated by IDS on the security status of an information system, also improve the detection of intrusions using snort by classifying the most critical alerts by their levels of risk, thus, only the alerts that presents a real threat will be displayed to the security administrator, so, we reduce the number of false positives, also we minimize the analysis time of the alerts. The model was evaluated using KDD Cup 99 Dataset as test environment and a pattern matching algorithm.},

abstract={Wireless technology is a central component of many factory automation infrastructures in both the commercial and government sectors, providing connectivity among various components in industrial realms (distributed sensors, machines, mobile process controllers). However wireless technologies provide more threats to computer security than wired environments. The advantageous features of Bluetooth technology resulted in Bluetooth units shipments climbing to five million per week at the end of 2005 [1, 2]. This is why the real-time interpretation and understanding of Bluetooth traffic behavior is critical in both maintaining the integrity of computer systems and increasing the efficient use of this technology in control type applications. Although neuro-fuzzy approaches have been applied to wireless 802.11 behavior analysis in the past, a significantly different Bluetooth protocol framework has not been extensively explored using this technology. This paper presents a new neuro-fuzzy traffic analysis algorithm of this still new territory of Bluetooth traffic. Further enhancements of this algorithm are presented along with the comparison against the traditional, numerical approach. Through test examples, interesting Bluetooth traffic behavior characteristics were captured, and the comparative elegance of this computationally inexpensive approach was demonstrated. This analysis can be used to provide directions for future development and use of this prevailing technology in various control type applications, as well as making the use of it more secure.},

abstract={Synchrophasor technology plays a pivotal role in developing the next generation of wide-area monitoring, protection, and control in the smart grid environment. As technology and communications infrastructures evolve, however, so do the attack surfaces in the synchrophasor network that can be exploited by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors to affect power system stability and reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel platform for developing a self-healing and attack-resilient PMU network (SHARP-Net) by instituting a state-of-the-art intrusion detection system (IDS) with an intrusion mitigation system (IMS) and an alert management system (AMS). In particular, the proposed platform detects anomalies during cyberattacks on phasor data concentrators (PDCs) based on the rules defined in the IDS, then the generated alerts are published to the IMS through the AMS. The proposed IMS proceeds to take automated corrective responses to mitigate cyberattacks by reconfiguring the synchrophasor network to isolate the compromised PDCs, and it orchestrates new PDCs to prevent the future propagation of attacks. Further, the IMS restores the system's observability by reconnecting the new PDCs to make the grid attack-resilient. In this work, the SHARP-Net platform is developed by using Python-based libraries, minimega's software-defined network, and virtual machine orchestration. We implement and validate the proposed SHARP-Net architecture by testing a PMU network in the smart grid environment. SHARP-Net showed promising performance in detecting cyberattacks and mitigating them through the network reconfiguration.},

pages={1-6},
abstract={This paper presents the automated RADAR system for the malicious traffic detection and the near realtime traffic diversion. RADAR is designed to detect and divert suspicious/malicious traffic (within an enterprise network) to safe locations for further analysis. Current practice requires the manual redirection of malicious traffic, incurs a significant amount of human effort, and results in major delay in response. The RADAR system includes network monitoring and traffic filtering/diversion with threat detection, ruleset generation, rule dissemination (similar to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Flowspec) and threat analysis capabilities. RADAR decouples Flowspec features from BGP routing and provides the flexibility to use any standard routing protocol such as BGP and OSPF to divert the traffic. BGP is used for the purpose of demonstration. A scalable and hybrid network testbed is developed to emulate an enterprise network, where normal and malicious traffic flows, i.e., denial of service (DoS) attacks, are generated. A NetFlow based network monitoring tool is used to provide near real-time traffic specification feedback and a flow based intrusion detection system is used to detect DoS TCP SYN attacks. Ruleset generation and diversion mechanisms are developed to construct BGP updates for the redirection of malicious flows. The successful diversion of malicious traffic is demonstrated with Cisco and Linux routers for testing different scenarios in the network testbed.},

abstract={Due to the rapid increment of the cyber attacks, intrusion detection system (IDS) is shifting towards collaborative approaches. There is a huge demand for securing larger networking environments for providing a safeguard against threats. In order to optimize the feasible detection performance, Collaborative Intrusion Detection Networks (CIDN) approaches have been adopted in practical scenarios, which enables a group of IDS nodes to mutually share and exchange mandatory information with each other, for example, IDS-signatures, attacks alarms. However, CIDN networks are distributed in nature, such networks still face plenty of implementation problems, especially, insider intruder can easily dominate any of security node and leave the entire security system vulnerable. To achieve the trust-based communication between each of IDS node, the recent advancement in blockchain applications is considered as a good fit to create trust-based communication in CIDN networks. This work converges CIDN network and blockchain in SDN context. Firstly, we investigated existing related work and highlighted challenges and research gap towards blockchain in CIDN networks. Secondly, we utilised three collaborated Snort IDS to receive the latest signature update from Ryu and then to securely share such signatures updates to all other Snort nodes within test-bed. Our work is motivated to detect seven types of common attacks with collaborated signature-based IDS, which feasibly processes more packets to achieve satisfactory detection results. Overall the evaluation results show that with the adoption of blockchain protocols, the proposed CIDN network achieves 96% of TP rate detection rate for TCP, UDP and ICMP packets.},

abstract={The smart grid faces growing cyber-physical attack threats aimed at the critical systems and processes communicating over the complex cyber-infrastructure. Thanks to the increasing availability of high-quality data and the success of deep learning algorithms, machine learning (ML)-based detection and classification have been increasingly effective and adopted against sophisticated attacks. However, many of these techniques rely on the assumptions that the training and testing datasets share the same distribution and the same class labels in a stationary environment. As such assumptions may fail to hold when the system dynamics shift and new threat variants emerge in a non-stationary environment, the capability of trained ML models to adapt in complex operating scenarios will be critical to their deployment in real-world smart grid communications. To this aim, this paper proposes a domain-adversarial transfer learning framework for robust intrusion detection against smart grid attacks. The framework introduces domain-adversarial training to create a mapping between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain so that the classifiers can learn in a new feature space against unknown threats. The proposed framework with different baseline classifiers was evaluated using a smart grid cyber-attack dataset collected over a realistic hardware-in-the- loop security testbed. The results have demonstrated effective performance improvements of trained classifiers against unseen threats of different types and locations.},

Even though web applications can provide efficiency in storing and managing a large amount of information, certain security issues can pose threat to information assurance. Those security issues, vulnerabilities that mainly include SQL injection, cross-site scripting etc can be prevented using the security scanners currently available. A web vulnerability scanner detects potential security vulnerabilities in web pages by accessing the web page through the front end. They provide the proficiency of detecting errors early. Meanwhile, they have some limitations. Overcoming the limitations still existing to a certain extent, several new techniques can perform far better.

year={2009},

pages={899-906},
abstract={Packet classification is one of the crucial components of application such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services. For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.},

abstract={The high penetration of residential air conditioners (RACs) poses a growing concern in emerging fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) in power systems. FIDVR is expected to be a significant threat to the stability and reliability of future power grids. Hence, the system planners should carry out appropriate simulation studies to mitigate the severe consequences of FIDVR events. A key question to implement these studies is how to determine the worst condition which results in FIDVR. Most of the actual FIDVR events have been experienced in the hot hours of the day and this issue makes one curious to think about the relationship between the FIDVR events and the ambient temperature. In this regard, a novel temperature-dependent RAC model is presented and verified by using laboratory tests. Furthermore, two cases with different power system loading patterns, i.e. the peak temperature hour and the peak demand hour, are examined. The proposed RAC model is implemented on the IEEE 118-bus test system. Moreover, an actual FIDVR event reported in Iran has been reproduced employing the proposed RAC model. Implemented simulations reveal that to precisely reproduce the recorded FIDVR event, it is necessary to consider the ambient temperature when the fault has been occurred.},

abstract={In cybersecurity, red teams emulate real threats and launch attack operations to assess an organization’s security posture and provide experience to it’s defenders. Although red team engagements share similarities with penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, they differ significantly in terms of goals and purpose. Moreover, just mimicking real threats does not make red teams APTs. This paper summarizes various academic and industrial views on the topic of cyber red teaming and aims at clarifying the common properties that differentiate it from other types of security assessments and real attackers. Based on evidence from case studies and various expert opinions, we have concluded that red teaming is a distinct type of security assessment, and that penetration tests are often mislabeled as red team engagements.},

abstract={Zero-day attacks, new (anomalous) attacks exploiting previously unknown system vulnerabilities, are a serious threat. Defending against them is no easy task, however. Having identified "degree of system knowledge" as one difference between legitimate and illegitimate users, theorists have drawn on information theory as a basis for intrusion detection. In particular, Kolmogorov complexity (K) has been used successfully. In this work, we consider information distance (Observed_K - Expected_K) as a method of detecting system scans. Observed_K is computed directly, Expected_K is taken from compression tests shared herein. Results are encouraging. Observed scan traffic has an information distance at least an order of magnitude greater than the threshold value we determined for normal Internet traffic. With 320 KB packet blocks, separation between distributions appears to exceed 4sigma},

abstract={It has been demonstrated that deception technologies are effective in detecting advanced persistent threats and zero-day attacks which cannot be detected by traditional signature-based intrusion detection techniques. Especially, a file-based deception technology is promising because it is very difficult (if not impossible) to commit an attack without reading and modifying any file. It can play as an additional security barrier because malicious file access can be detected even if an adversary succeeds in gaining access to a host. However, PhantomFS still has a problem that is common to deception technologies. Once a deception technology is known to adversaries, it is unlikely to succeed in alluring adversaries. In this paper, we classify adversaries who are aware of PhantomFS according to their knowledge level and permission of PhantomFS. Then we analyze the attack surface and develop a defense strategy to limit the attack vectors. We extend PhantomFS to realize the strategy. Specifically, we introduce multiple hidden interfaces and detection of file execution. We evaluate the security and performance overhead of the proposed technique. We demonstrate that the extended PhantomFS is secure against intelligent adversaries by penetration testing. The extended PhantomFS offers higher detection accuracy with lower false alarm rate compared to existing techniques. It is also demonstrated that the overhead is negligible in terms of response time and CPU time.},

abstract={Data exfiltration is the unauthorized leakage of confidential data from a system. Unlike intrusions that seek to overtly disable or damage a system, it is particularly hard to detect because it uses a variety of low/slow vectors and advanced persistent threats (APTs). It is often assisted (intentionally or not) by an insider who might be an employee who downloads a trojan or uses a hardware component that has been tampered with or acquired from an unreliable source. Conventional scan and test based detection approaches work poorly, especially for hardware with embedded trojans. We describe a framework to detect potential exfiltration events that actively monitors of a set of key parameters that cover the entire stack, from hardware to the application layer. An attack alert is generated only if several monitors detect suspicious activity within a short temporal window. The cross-layer monitoring and integration helps ensure accurate alerts with fewer false positives and makes designing a successful attack more difficult.},

abstract={With the entry into the embedded domain, security of SOC architectures has become an arena of importance. However, complexity and cost factors have forced us to outsource the VLSI design phases across the globe. Such sites may not be trusted and threat lies in the introduction of malicious intrusions at any stage of the design flow. Such malicious intrusions, also known as Hardware Trojan Horses (HTH) remain dormant during the testing phase but get triggered at runtime and threaten the integrity and confidentiality of the chip. In this paper, we focus on threat to confidentiality. HTH threatens the confidentiality of such chips by leaking the secret information at runtime. We propose an intelligent architecture, Runtime Trust Neural Architecture (RTNA) based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART 1) neural network, which when incorporated with the SOC architecture can prevent it at runtime from being compromised confidentially. Low area and low power overhead of our proposed RTNA on practical crypto SOC architectures as obtained in the experimental results confirm its practical implementation. Hardware implementation of trust generation at runtime, use of unsupervised learning and use of an intelligent architecture are the novelties of this work.},

abstract={Fault Induced Delayed Voltage Recovery (FIDVR) can cause a threat to the power system voltage stability. Due to the increasing penetration of Air Conditioning (A/C) loads in the power system and the specific behavior of these types of loads, the speed of voltage recovery is significantly reduced when a short circuit fault occurs in the power system. In this paper, a number of common A/Cs installed in the tropical region of southern Iran are investigated and their developed models are compared against the results of the related experimental modeling in other references. Subsequently, a comprehensive model is developed to simulate the behavior of A/C loads in a power system. To determine the power system vulnerabilities to voltage recovery, a screening method is proposed. Additionally, to increase the speed of voltage recovery, the “Impedance Deviation based Load Shedding” method is proposed. Using this method, the most effective buses in the improvement of delayed voltage recovery, are found and subsequently, the amount and priority of the load elimination needed to reduce the effects of FIDVR are determined. The results of simulations on the IEEE 39-bus test system, verifies the high performance of the load models employed and also the load shedding method used to address the FIDVR phenomenon.},

abstract={Emerging intelligent systems have stringent constraints including cost and power consumption. When they are used in critical applications, resiliency becomes another key requirement. Much research into techniques for fault tolerance and dependability has been successfully applied to highly critical systems, such as those used in space, where cost is not an overriding constraint. Further, most resiliency techniques were focused on dealing with failures in the hardware and bugs in the software. The next generation of systems used in critical applications will also have to be tolerant to test escapes after manufacturing, soft errors and transients in the electronics, hardware bugs, hardware and software Trojans and viruses, as well as intrusions and other security attacks during operation. This paper will assess the impact of these threats on the results produced by a critical system, and proposed solutions to each of them. It is argued that run-time checks at the application-level are necessary to deal with errors in the results.},

abstract={Security of VMs is now becoming a hot topic due to their outsourcing in cloud computing paradigm. All VMs present on the network are connected to each other, making exploited VMs danger to other VMs. and threats to organization. Rejuvenation of virtualization brought the emergence of hyper-visor based security services like VMI (Virtual machine introspection). As there is a greater chance for any intrusion detection system running on the same system, of being dis-abled by the malware or attacker. Monitoring of VMs using VMI, is one of the most researched and accepted technique, that is used to ensure computer systems security mostly in the paradigm of cloud computing. This thesis presents a work that is to integrate LibVMI with Volatility on a KVM, a Linux based hypervisor, to introspect memory of VMs. Both of these tools are used to monitor the state of live VMs. VMI capability of monitoring VMs is combined with the malware analysis and virtual honeypots to achieve the objective of this project. A testing environment is deployed, where a network of VMs is used to be introspected using Volatility plug-ins. Time execution of each plug-in executed on live VMs is calculated to observe the performance of Volatility plug-ins. All these VMs are deployed as Virtual Honeypots having honey-pots configured on them, which is used as a detection mechanism to trigger alerts when some malware attack the VMs. Using STIX (Structure Threat Information Expression), extracted IOCs are converted into the understandable, flexible, structured and shareable format.},

abstract={With the continuous expansion and deepening of ICVs, advanced technologies continue to emerge, making ICVs more intelligent to serve and protect drivers. Although the development of ICVs has brought great convenience and better driving experiences for users, at the same time it also brings many intrusion portals for malicious attackers. There are many hostile invaders who only focus on how to achieve malicious invasions by exploiting some attack technologies, such as stealing users' privacy via SCA. However, technology is a double-edged sword. We can utilize existing attack technologies to do something meaningful, which is beneficial to social development. To this end, the security threats are investigated in ICVs, especially the application of SCA. After that, we propose the schemes of driver identification and illegal driver detection by using SCA, and provide an insight into the advantages and limitations of each scheme. The experimental results showed that identity authentication accuracy can reach 100 percent by using at least 10-minute training data and more than 1-minute testing data. Based on recent progress, future research opportunities are discussed to motivate more researchers to focus on the safety of ICVs.},

abstract={The digital smart-home ecosystem comprised of the smart sensing devices and those that the user interacts with, have the ability to monitor users' activities without user awareness or consent. While the intelligence provided by these devices and systems, particularly through recommendations and reminders for user activities, are helpful, they also border on the level of intrusion to the user. The framework of the smart home devices poses a potential privacy threat once the insights gained from the data are beyond simple reminders or recommendations, and rather active inference of the person's sensitive or private information. We hypothesize that it is possible a smart-home user's privacy can be compromised with the location information and temporal sampling of the user's context by the sensors. In this work, we explore testing this hypothesis towards understanding privacy intrusion by reverse engineering a privacy intrusion model using derived insights from the sensors' data. While there can be numerous facets to privacy, we categorize our privacy model development along six attributes: personal identity, localization within the smart-space, finance activity, social interaction, genealogy history and emotional attributes. As a first step in this exploration, we set up experiments in a real-world office room environment to study privacy intrusion of a single user using off-the-shelf smart sensing devices already existing in homes today.},

abstract={When a software system starts behaving abnormally during normal operations, system administrators resort to the use of logs, execution traces, and system scanners (e.g., anti-malwares, intrusion detectors, etc.) to diagnose the cause of the anomaly. However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.). Our case study on a modern Linux server shows that Total ADS automatically detects attacks on the server, shows anomalous paths in traces, and provides forensic insights.},

abstract={Dynamic fuzzy rule interpolation (D-FRI) consists of functionalities of fuzzy rule interpolation and dynamically refinement of the fuzzy rule base. It can be integrated with any fuzzy intelligent system to extend the system's capabilities in addition to its normal fuzzy reasoning. Systems security is one of the areas that require dynamic monitoring due to the nature of possible threats; static rule-based systems cannot cover all reoriented security threats accurately in the long run. D-FRI provides a possible solution to such problems, potentially making various security tools (e.g., those for firewall, intrusion detection and traffic analysis) more effective. As a particular application, this paper exploits D-FRI to dynamically support Microsoft Windows Firewall, resulting in a robust system named D-FRI-WinFirewall. Given the general utility of Windows Firewall, the impact of this work is far-reaching. The work reported here focusses on the monitoring and prevention of denial of service (DoS) attacks, which is not possible by utilising the standard Windows Firewall alone. In particular, two sub-systems are designed, implemented and tested within D-FRI-WinFirewall, with an effort to detect and prevent two serious types of DoS attack: ICMP DoS attack and UDP DoS attack, leading the Windows Firewall to outperform popular and expensive firewalls, which are yet unable to handle DoS attacks.},

abstract={At present, the security has become an important issue in the field of cloud computing. The importance and urgency of the problem cannot be ignored. The popularization and application of cloud computing is a great challenge and opportunity in the field of information security in recent years. It can be seen that cloud computing security is changing to a hot spot for technology and academic research in cloud computing. This paper is aim to solve the problem of Cloud Security. According to the unique properties of cloud computing security, it proposes a secure management scheme in cloud computing. This scheme is used to detect the hacker attacks, illegal operation, potential threats and other security events in time based on big data. There are three main sections in the scheme: vulnerability scan, system log collection, correlation analysis. They are simply introduced and analyzed in this paper. Vulnerability scan: regular using of Nikto, Sandcat or other security tools for the cloud system to carry out the vulnerability scanning, regular network security self-testing, and building an extremely detailed scan report. System log collection: Using of Splunk, Nagios or other tools to collect the system log, also building a detailed log report. Correlation analysis: through the correlation analysis or canonical correlation analysis is used on the system log reports and vulnerability scanning reports, the attacker's attack will be found and the system will be issued a warning in time. At last, the scheme was built in the company's test environment, then the test environment was attacked by penetration test which is to simulate the act of hacking, the feasibility and function of it are verified by the testing.},

abstract={Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Results showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks},

abstract={The digitization of smart grid distributed generation and industrial control systems has prompted utilities to deploy tools with ubiquitous communications that potentially widen the attack surface. The utilities still continue to rely on the traditional cybersecurity technologies, such as firewalls, anti-malware tools, and passwords that do not ensure security across all dimensions of the information assurance model required for a strong cybersecurity business process. This paper proposes a multidimensional holistic framework that addresses this gap through advanced technologies, intelligent algorithms, and continued assessments. To show proof, the layered defense model, a solution dimension of the framework, is integrated into the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Security and Resilience Testbed to replicate a utility's enterprise and substation networks. The model is used to evaluate the security and resilience of microgrid control systems, and, based on the insights gathered, recommend best practices for utility cybersecurity analysts for a strong business process. With this baseline, the paper conceptually introduces intelligence-driven solutions comprising contextual data analysis and machine learning to respond to advanced persistent threats sponsored by campaign efforts.},

abstract={Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks burden a huge threat to the internet society. Multiple infected computers commanded by the attacker execute the attack to overwhelm the target. In this paper, we propose a DDoS attack detection method based on non-parametric community clustering algorithm. It is applied using the connections between the source and destination sides of packet headers. Main advantage of this clustering algorithm is that it does not require any predetermined parameters compared to classical clustering algorithms such as k-Means algorithm. For evaluating the clustering process, two metrics are used which are modularity and normalized entropy. They perform significant changes during the attack traffic. To detect these changes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized. This proposed algorithm is tested on the real data collected from Boğaziçi University network and Caida dataset.},

abstract={Network data collection is a vital part in the process of network monitoring, traffic billing, network management and intrusion detection. As a new kind of network architecture, Software Defined Network (SDN) provides a possibility of intelligent and adaptive network data collection with centralized control and programming. However, existing literatures lack a concrete solution to economically collect network data, while satisfying the quality of data processing and analytics. Current data collection methods are not sufficiently adaptive and intelligent in terms of network context awareness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive network data collection system in SDN by automatically selecting proper data collection nodes based on network status in a dynamic way. During data collection, network traffic is sampled by considering flow characteristics in order to effectively reduce the amount of collected data while ensuring the accuracy of later data analysis, e.g., malicious traffic detection. A series of experiments are conducted to test and verify the data collection system and show its advantages through comparison with existing works in terms of CPU/memory consumption, storage usage, flow size recovery, and threat perception.},

abstract={Business enterprises are competing to get their applications up and running faster with improved manageability and less maintenance by reassigning the ability to IT specialists to adjust resources in order to meet business fluctuating needs. This can be achieved through utilizing the Cloud Computing Model which is distinguished by ‘pay as you go’ model. The model offers solutions of storage, convenient and on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. As with any novel technology, Cloud Computing is subject to security threats and vulnerabilities including network threats, information threats and underlying infrastructure threats. In this paper, we present a framework by which penetration testing is conducted to highlight possible vulnerabilities within our private Cloud Computing infrastructure, simulate attacks to exploit discovered vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service (DoS) and Man-in-the-Cloud attacks, apply countermeasures to prevent such attacks, and then to exemplify a recommended best practice protection mechanism which will contribute to the Cloud Computing security.},

abstract={Cyber attacking is one of the most concerning threats in military operation nowadays. In Cyber warfare concept, cyberspace is very logical comparing to the other 4 battlefields including land, water, air, and space. It is almost impossible to identify physical location of hosts in Latitude/Longitude, not even direction or distance from one to another. Traditional boundaries disappear within cyberspace. Moreover, separated activities can be done from many locations via computer network. In this information age, information superiority is translated into combat power. Robust and secure network is significantly needed as a core media for information operation e.g. censoring and sharing. However, Cyber risk environment in the battlefield is not yet clarified. Vulnerability detection, penetration testing, and risk evaluation are parts of network security. Therefore, this paper proposes a cyber-risk evaluation framework that integrates “Network Risk Metric” and “Risk Environment” of military operation together in order to get a better understanding of cyber risk in the battlefield.},
