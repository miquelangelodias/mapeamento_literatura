abstract={This article is devoted to the development of measures, such as organizational, technical and legal measures, to ensure the reliability of the functioning of information systems in respect to governmental and critically important information systems. The article talks about measures and recommendations to ensure the reliability of Information Systems in relation to Public Information Systems; measures to Ensure the reliability of Information Systems in relation to Critical Information Systems, main criteria for classifying information and communication infrastructure objects as critical information and communication infrastructure objects, critical sectors, their subsectors and critical services, questionnaires for the evaluation of infrastructure providing critical services, criteria for assessing the criticality of services, differences between standard information system (IS) and critical information system; looks at one of the possible options for the process of sustainable operation of critical information system. The application of the proposed methods and approaches will increase the level of reliability of information systems, to ensure the timely identification and elimination of relevant risks. Ensuring the reliability of information systems in relation to public information systems envolves things such as: organizing control over the activity planning aimed at reliable and safe functioning of state information system; implementing processes to ensure the reliability, fault tolerance and security of information systems; formation of regulatory requirements to ensure the reliability of public information system; monitoring the continuous training and certification of employees working with information system; raising awareness of employees and management responsible for the performance of public information systems on the most relevant threats, vulnerabilities, risks and incidents related to the reliability and security of information system; conducting regular audit and assessment of the level of ensuring the reliability of state information system; carrying out preventive measures to eliminate incidents and reduce the risk of information system failures; connecting the telecommunications network to a single gateway to the Internet; connecting the state information system to the information security event monitoring system and transmission of operational information on threats and incidents to the national Information Security coordination center. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={Sophisticated mass attacks, especially when exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, have the potential to cause destructive damage to organizations and critical infrastructure. To timely detect and contain such attacks, collaboration among the defenders is critical. By correlating real-time detection information (threat indicators) from multiple sources, defenders can detect attacks and take the appropriate measures in time. However, although the technical tools to facilitate collaboration exist, real-world adoption of such collaborative security mechanisms is still underwhelming. This is largely due to a lack of trust and participation incentives for companies and organizations. This paper proposes TRIDEnT, a novel collaborative platform that aims to enable parties to exchange network threat indicators, thus increasing their overall detection capabilities. TRIDEnT allows parties that may be in a competitive relationship, to selectively advertise, sell and acquire threat indicators in the form of (near) real-time peer-to-peer streams. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we instantiate our design in a decentralized manner using Ethereum smart contracts and provide a fully functional prototype. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={The evolving of Fifth Generation (5G) networks is becoming more readily available as a significant driver of the growth of new applications and business models. Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) represent the critical enablers of 5G technology with the development of next-generation intelligent vehicular networks and applications. In recent years, researchers have focused on the integration of SDN and VANET, and looked at different topics related to the architecture, the benefits of software-defined VANET services, and the new functionalities to adapt them. However, the security and robustness of the complete architecture is still questionable and have been largely neglected by the research community. Moreover, the deployment and integration of different entities and several architectural components drive new security threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, first, we survey the state-of-the-art SDN based Vehicular ad-hoc Network (SDVN) architectures for their networking infrastructure design, functionalities, benefits, and challenges. Then we discuss these architectures against major security threats that violate the key security services such as availability, privacy, authentication, and data integrity. We also discuss different countermeasures for these threats. Finally, we present the lessons learned with the directions of future research work towards provisioning stringent security solutions in new SDVN architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that presents a comprehensive survey and security analysis on SDVN architectures, and we believe that it will help researchers to address various challenges (e.g., flexible network management, control and high resource utilization, and scalability) in vehicular communication systems which are required to improve the future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). © 2020},

abstract={Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the process of using tools and information to passively learn enough information about an organization to begin the cyber attack cycle. OSINT gathering is often the first step in a malicious cyber campaign. Social Media and the Internet (e.g., search engines, open source tools, blogs) are quickly becoming invaluable sources of information for malicious cyber actors. These two very popular forms of technology are notorious for inherently accumulating and archiving personal information about people, organizations, and networks. These technologies also give information perpetual life, which can be summoned at any time by those in possession of the right knowledge (i.e., Data Science) and tools to extract this information. We posit that the extent of these privacy violations have increased to the point where OSINT identified vulnerabilities may be as useful to attackers as zero-day vulnerabilities, since organizations are likely just as unaware of their presence. We refer to the tools and techniques used to identify these types of vulnerabilities as privacy violating OSINT (PV-OSINT). In this paper, we bring to light the very serious damage that can be done to critical infrastructure (CI), by the use of PV-OSINT. We tested our methodology with a real CI, we then shared our findings with the CI owner to verify the efficacy of our approach. Then we developed a framework that could be used by CI owners to constantly assess the security of their networks using PV-OSINT. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={As some terrorist groups have undoubtedly acquired some missiles, preparing a spatial model for the analysis of such threats is of great importance for countries. Intelligent air-based threats are considered as the main elements of the terrorist attacks that damage the critical infrastructures. Air defense systems playing a strategic and decisive role in defense networks require smart management and operational mechanisms to countermeasure the threats and risks, both quickly and decisively. The spread of terrorist groups, security around the world, have been threatened and should think over to reduce the vulnerability and increase the safety of critical infrastructures. Target safety management needs to consider all parameters that affect the vulnerability of the target. To exploration of the nature of each factor that effect the vulnerability of target against the airborne threat and the relation between factors will lead to the creation of a spatial model. Our suggested spatial model facilitates the analysis, planning, and decision-making to reduce the vulnerability of target. A model proposed to minimize the vulnerability of targets and to banish airborne threats equipped with GPS and INS. In conclusion, the proposed model was observed to reduce the vulnerability of the target compared with the usual method. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

abstract={The Executive Order 13800—Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure—issued by the President of the United States, calls for an evaluation of the “readiness and gaps in the United States’ ability to manage and mitigate consequences of a cyber incident against the electricity subsector.” In May of 2018, the Office of Management and Budget finished evaluating the 96 risk assessments conducted by various agencies and published Federal Cybersecurity Risk Determination Report and Action Plan (Risk Report). While the report embraced a broad defending forward strategy, it made no reference to smart grids or their vulnerable intelligent substations and did not address how federal agencies plan to respond to emerging threats to these systems. While the paper does not discuss how to attack the smart grids in the cyber domain, the contribution to the academic debate lies in validating some of the vulnerabilities of the grid’s substations in order for government, private industry, academia, and civil society to better collaborate in disrupting or halting malicious cyber activities before they disrupt the power supply of the United States and its Transatlantic allies. We also discuss how Artificial Intelligence and related techniques can mitigate security risks to cyber-physical systems. Until this technology becomes available, however, standardization of cyber security efforts must be enforced through regulatory means, such as the enforcement of security-by-design Intelligent Electronic Devices and protocols for the smart grid. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

abstract={Modern cybercrimes have exponentially grown over the last one decade. Ransomware is one of the types of malware which is the result of sophisticated attempt to compromise the modern computer systems. The governments and large corporations are investing heavily to combat this cyber threat against their critical infrastructure. It has been observed that over the last few years that Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have become the main target of Ransomware due to the sensitive operations involved in the day to day processes of these industries. As the technology is evolving, more and more traditional industrial systems are replaced with advanced industry methods involving advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT). These technology shift help improve business productivity and keep the company's global competitive in an overflowing competitive market. However, the systems involved need secure measures to protect integrity and availability which will help avoid any malfunctioning to their operations due to the cyber-attacks. There have been several cyber-attack incidents on healthcare, pharmaceutical, water cleaning and energy sector. These ICS' s are operated by remote control facilities and variety of other devices such as programmable logic controllers (PLC) and sensors to make a network. Cyber criminals are exploring vulnerabilities in the design of these ICS's to take the command and control of these systems and disrupt daily operations until ransomware is paid. This paper will provide critical analysis of the impact of Ransomware threat on SCADA systems. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: The common implementation practices of modern industrial control systems (ICS) has left a window wide open to various security vulnerabilities. As the cyber-threat landscape continues to evolve, the ICS and their underlying architecture must be protected to withstand cyber-attacks. This study aims to review several ICS security assessment methodologies to identify an appropriate vulnerability assessment method for the ICS systems that examine both critical physical and cyber systems so as to protect the national critical infrastructure. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews several ICS security assessment methodologies and explores whether the existing methodologies are indeed sufficient to meet the cyber security assessment exercise required to validate the security of electrical power control systems. Findings: The study showed that most of the examined methodologies seem to concentrate on vulnerability identification and prioritisation techniques, whilst other security techniques received noticeably less attention. The study also showed that the least attention is devoted to patch management process due to the critical nature of the SCADA system. Additionally, this review portrayed that only two security assessment methodologies exhibited absolute fulfilment of all NERC-CIP security requirements, whilst the others only partially fulfilled the essential requirements. Originality/value: This paper presents a review and a comparative analysis of several standard SCADA security assessment methodologies and guidelines published by internationally recognised bodies. In addition, it explores the adequacy of the existing methodologies in meeting cyber security assessment practices required for electrical power networks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Critical infrastructure experienced a transformation from isolated towards highly (inter-)connected systems. This development introduced a variety of new cyber threats, causing high financial damage, threatening lives and affecting the society. Known examples are Stuxnet, WannaCry and the attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. To prevent such attacks, it is indispensable to properly design, assess and maintain countermeasures and security strategies throughout the whole life cycle of the critical systems. For this, security has to be considered and assessed for every system design and redesign. However, common assessment tools and methodologies are not executed on a detailed system knowledge and therefore they are enhanced with penetration tests. Unfortunately, performing only abstract assessments is inadequate and penetration tests endanger the availability of the tested systems. Therefore, the latter cannot be performed on live systems executing critical processes. In this paper, we address these issues for Industrial Control Systems and explain how new concepts for continuous security-by-design or model-based system monitoring and automated vulnerability assessments can resolve them by exploiting new Industry 4.0 developments. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The convergence of advances in biotechnology with laboratory automation, access to data, and computational biology has democratized biotechnology and accelerated the development of new therapeutics. However, increased access to biotechnology in the digital age has also introduced additional security concerns and ultimately, spawned the new discipline of cyberbiosecurity, which encompasses cybersecurity, cyber-physical security, and biosecurity considerations. With the emergence of this new discipline comes the need for a logical, repeatable, and shared approach for evaluating facility and system vulnerabilities to cyberbiosecurity threats. In this paper, we outline the foundation of an assessment framework for cyberbiosecurity, accounting for both security and resilience factors in the physical and cyber domains. This is a unique problem set, but despite the complexity of the cyberbiosecurity field in terms of operations and governance, previous experience developing and implementing physical and cyber assessments applicable to a wide spectrum of critical infrastructure sectors provides a validated point of departure for a cyberbiosecurity assessment framework. This approach proposes to integrate existing capabilities and proven methodologies from the infrastructure assessment realm (e.g., decision science, physical security, infrastructure resilience, cybersecurity) with new expertise and requirements in the cyberbiosecurity space (e.g., biotechnology, biomanufacturing, genomics) in order to forge a flexible and defensible approach to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities. Determining where vulnerabilities reside within cyberbiosecurity business processes can help public and private sector partners create an assessment framework to identify mitigation options for consideration that are both economically and practically viable and ultimately, allow them to manage risk more effectively. © 2019 Schabacker, Levy, Evans, Fowler and Dickey.},

abstract={Computer facilities and microprocessor-based technology have been successfully used in the energy industry. For protection and equipment control, this technology has been used in SCADA, remote control and monitoring applications. Particular attention is paid to the cyber security sector for automation and control systems. Protective application of the equipment and control, SCADA, monitoring and remote control, uses the technology with microprocessor. Due to the great importance of the power supply process, there is no question of being left in a state of vulnerability and neglect. Security is not perfect and will never be. For this reason, there will always be security breaches and incidents. Also, for this reason, not only protection mechanisms are in place, but also mechanisms for rapid detection of incidents and which are able to react effectively to the isolation of problems and to ensuring security. Processes security for systems will continue to evolve in the future. By definition, there are no communication systems that are 100% safe. Attacks against critical industrial infrastructures marked an increase not only in terms of number but also of the level of complexity. The destruction of the industrial control system (ICS) and critical processes were interrupted. For many organizations, the security improvement in ICS systems is great. The extreme sensitivity to ensure the availability and performance of industrial processes has led to a more conservative and rigorous approach to how security measures are implemented. Cyber-attacks that could compromise the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of ICS systems may come from within systems or from outside ICS systems. Among the ICS system infection vectors from the perspective of the SANS Institute (2014) include: external threats (state attacks, hacking etc.), malware, exploiting tools, phishing, internal attacks, cyber security protocols, and industrial espionage. This chapter addresses the cyber security issues required for the protection, automation, control and communications systems of transformation stations as well as methods that could be used to prevent computer attacks that can have a significant impact on the availability of the system Electro-energetic effect with serious consequences on extended area interruptions. The chapter consists of five parts as follows: In the first part the concept of critical infrastructure is approached. It starts from the definition of the term, the protection of critical infrastructure and, last but not least, dangers and threats from the virtual space;In the second part, the industrial control systems in the power stations are presented in terms of vulnerabilities, how to implement the security measures, and so on;The third part is intended for monitoring, control and data acquisition (SCADA). Specifically, the SCADA system is presented at the level of an electrical station, with all the problems that may arise during its operation;The intelligent power grids (Smart Grids) are presented in Part Four. A Smart Grid includes software and hardware designed to significantly improve the functionality of the system. Smart Grid faces a number of security situations related to regulatory systems, Smart Meters, status estimation, and communications networks. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The aviation industry is a growing interconnected system that relies on computer-based information technology (IT) systems for operations. Several cyberattacks within the aviation community have been reported between 2016 and 2018 varying from terrorism, spying, financial gain and hackers attempting to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. The management of such incidents is a challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa as information security frameworks and mechanisms, required to cope with an increasing number of cyberattacks, are not standardised. To be able to stay ahead of evolving cyberattacks within and outside their organisation, responsibility needs to be shared between participants in the aviation industry to secure aviation systems. This paper analyses current best practice cyber security response standards that can be adopted by the Sub-Saharan Africa aviation sector. It is proposed that an aviation CSIRT is needed to effectively manage threats to critical infrastructure. A literature review critically review challenges, international developments and current best practise cybersecurity incident response standards as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and established global CSIRTs. An review of the established South African Cybersecurity Hub determines the extent to which it has matured. Findings reveal that the South African Cybersecurity Hub does not currently address aviation cyber security incident response management for aviation. Finally, the paper proposes that an implementation of a Sub-Saharan Africa aviation CSIRT and the adoption of best practise cybersecurity incident response standards is a practical solution to manage aviation cyberattacks. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

abstract={Cyber-physical systems, representing the integration of computing, network and physical processes, are increasingly being implemented into critical infrastructure, processes of community management and private life of people. Due to their excessive complexity, the number of vulnerabilities in both the software and the physical part of the equipment significantly increases, which in turn leads to increased risks from the implementation of possible threats. Implementation of the overwhelming part of cyber threats occurs through intelligent telecommunication networks, attacks on data transmission protocols, intellectual part of data sources in executive mechanisms of systems, as well as local control centers of the system. The construction of adequate requirements for the system of cybernetic protection implies a careful approach to the study of the architecture and technical features of the cyberphysical system to be protected. As in any real engineering system, in systems of protection of cyber-physics systems, modeling of internal processes plays a key role in the analysis of their dynamic behavior. It is shown that the only model of the cyberphysical system is to describe at the formal level in spatial and temporal measure all possible connections between the cybernetic and physical parts of the functioning environment and to substantiate the characteristics that determine the quality of its functioning. This analysis of published works shows that the most dangerous attacks used by security breachers in cybernetic space are divided into attacks such as DoS attacks, Replay attacks and Deception attacks. It is against the attacks of this type that the efforts of specialists in the field of cybernetic defense are concentrated. It is shown that ensuring stability, security and reliability of protection is based on solving the problem of multi-purpose optimization. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

abstract={Critical Infrastructures (CIs) increasingly leverage Cloud computing given its benefits of on-demand scalability, high availability and cost efficiency. However, the Cloud is typically characterized by the co-location of users from varied security domains that also use shared computing resources. This introduces a number of resource/architecture-level vulnerabilities. For example, the usage of a basic shared storage component, such as a memory cache, can expose the entire Cloud system to security risks such as covert-channel attacks. The success of these exploits depends on various execution environment properties. Thus, providing means to assess the feasibility of these attacks in a specific execution environment and enabling postmortem analysis is needed. While attacks at the architectural level represent a potent vulnerability to exfiltrate information, the low-level often get neglected with techniques such as intrusion detection focused more on the high-level network/middleware threats. Interestingly, cache-based covert-channel attacks are typically not detectable by traditional intrusion detection systems as covert channels do not obey any access rights or other security policies. This paper focuses on the information provided at the low architectural level to cope with the cache-based covert-channel threat. We propose the usage of feasibility metrics collected at the low level to monitor the core-private cache covert channel and, infer information regarding the probability of a covert-channel exploit happening. We also illustrate the applicability of the proposed feasibility metrics in a use case. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Virtualization is technological revolution that separates functions from underlying hardware and allows us to create useful environment from abstract resources. Virtualization technology has been targeted by attackers for malicious activity. Attackers could compromise VM infrastructures, allowing them to access other VMs on the same system and even the host. Our article emphasize on the assessment of virtualization specific vulnerabilities, security issues and possible solutions. In this article, a recent comprehensive survey on virtualization threats and vulnerabilities is presented. We also described taxonomy of cloud-based attacks on the virtualized system and existing defense mechanisms intended to help academia, industry and researchers to gain deeper and valuable insights into the attacks so that the associated vulnerabilities can be identified and subsequently required actions would be taken. We provide an exhaustive comparison of various techniques proposed by researchers to resolve virtualization specific vulnerabilities. To guide future research, we discussed generalized security measures and requirements to be taken to achieve secure virtualized implementations. At the end, we shed some light on cloud shared responsibility model to decide which roles cloud service providers and cloud service customers play in cloud security.

abstract={People use infrastructure systems mostly without realizing how important these systems are until an attack or damage occurs and results in casualties or causes discomfort or inconvenience. Even though there have been numerous studies on critical infrastructure protection in the literature, there has not been any published document on a simplified approach on the risk assessment and protection of existing subway stations. With this motivation, this paper aims to describe and summarize the results of a Threat and Vulnerability Risk Assessment (TVRA) study designed for a generic subway station complex. The scope is to provide the details of the TVRA process for a typical existing station, for typical assets, with a simplified approach. The paper not only presents the TVRA procedure but also provides recommendations for mitigation strategies that would help reduce the risk of threats to existing subway station. The existing subway station is assumed to be in downtown of a relatively large city, therefore close to a business district, located within densely occupied commercial building developments. While each station complex has its own unique characteristics, the methodology shared in this manuscript is generic and can be implemented for any station in the world. © 2018 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

abstract={Modern critical infrastructures are characterized by a high degree of complexity, in terms of vulnerabilities, threats, and interdependencies that characterize them. The possible causes of a digital assault or occurrence of a digital attack are not simple to identify, as they may be due to a chain of seemingly insignificant incidents, the combination of which provokes the occurrence of scalar effects on multiple levels. Similarly, the digital explosion of technologies related to the critical infrastructure and the technical characteristics of their subsystems entails the continuous production of a huge amount of data from heterogeneous sources, requiring the adoption of intelligent techniques for critical analysis and optimal decision making. In many applications (e.g. network traffic monitoring) data is received at a high frequency over time. Thus, it is not possible to store all historical samples, which implies that they should be processed in real time and that it may not be possible to re-review old samples (one-pass constraint). We should consider the importance of protecting critical infrastructure, combined with the fact that many of these systems are cyber-attack targets, but they cannot easily be disconnected from their layout as this could lead to generalized operational problems. This research paper proposes a Multi-Task Learning model for Real-Time Large-Scale Data Analytics, towards the Cyber protection of Critical Infrastructure. More specifically, it suggests the Multi Overlap LEarning STReaming Analytics (MOLESTRA) which is a standardization of the »Kappa» architecture. The aim is the analysis of large data sets where the tasks are executed in an overlapping manner. This is done to ensure the utilization of the cognitive or learning relationships among the data flows. The proposed architecture uses the k-NN Classifier with Self Adjusting Memory (k-NN SAM). MOLESTRA, provides a clear and effective way to separate the short-term from the long-term memory. In this way the temporal intervals between the transfer of knowledge from one memory to the other and vice versa are differentiated. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years maritime logistics infrastructures are the global links among societies and economies. This challenges adversaries to intrude on the cyber-dependent ICTs by performing high-level intelligent techniques. A potential cyber-attack on such infrastructures can cause tremendous damages starting from supply chain service disruption ending up with threatening the whole human welfare. Current risk management policies embed significant limitations in terms of capturing the specific security requirements of ICTs and control/monitoring devices, such as IoT platforms, satellites and time installations, which are primary functioning for the provision of Maritime Logistics and Supply Chain (MLoSC) services. This work presents a novel risk assessment methodology capable of addressing the security particularities and specificities of the complex nature of SCADA infrastructures and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) of the Maritime Logistics Industry. The methodology identifies asset vulnerabilities and threats to estimate the cyber-risks and their cascading effects within the supply chain, introducing a set of subsequent security assessment services. The utilization of these services is demonstrated via a critical, real-life SCADA scenario indicating how they can facilitate supply chain operators in comprehending the threat landscape of their infrastructures and guide them how to adopt optimal mitigation strategies to counter or eliminate their cyber-risks. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) are vital for countries’ industrial facilities and critical infrastructures. However, there are not enough security assessments against cyber attacks carried out on ICS for not preventing business continuity. New attacks are being made every day against these systems. Threats and attacks against critical infrastructures must be detected for protecting human life and assets. For this reason, detection has become more important than the prevention of attacks. In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the critical systems. In the analysis, mirroring technique was used to prevent the detection system from imposing additional load to the existing system and affecting the operation of the system negatively. In the test environment, Siemens S-7 1200 (Firmware 2.2) PLC devices were used. Smoothsec system, which is not used in industrial systems, is used for detection and rule table. It is assessed that this novel approach will provide significant contributions to attract attention to vulnerabilities and the security analysis of industrial control systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS), at the heart of critical infrastructures, have been developing into more and more powerful tools over the years with the incorporation of networking and cyber, among other, technologies. As with great power comes great risks, ICS's inherited risks and vulnerabilities not only from the cyber domain but also gave rise to unique security risks and vulnerabilities. Security management, i.e., identifying vulnerabilities, assessing threats, preventing and tolerating malicious and harmful activities, mitigating and recovering from attacks, etc., for ICS's have been identified as a key, if not the key, area for the protection of critical infrastructures. The importance of a test-bed mimicking a real-life ICS and having capabilities to support ICS security management is paramount. In this paper, after briefly surveying the vulnerabilities in ICS and surveying the existing ICS test-beds, we describe the implementation of a virtual ICS testbed controlling the distribution breaker system of a power grid.

abstract={There exists a connection between a growing number of Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAxS) and a number of possible security challenges. The likelihood that swarms of UAxS will be employed in high populated mega-city environments in the long and mid-term exacerbates these future challenges. The problem is two-fold: UAxS are likely to be used as additional capability for friendly forces, but they are also to be considered as possible threat. The challenges that an autonomous system poses depend not only on their physical vulnerability or the security of the networks and data, but also on the interaction with traditional troops and operating procedures to be followed, their levels of autonomy and Command and Control (C2) chain behind their employment. An extensive experimentation is necessary to address some of these challenges in a Concept Development and Experimentation (CD&E) process aimed to envision solutions. Modelling and Simulation (M&S) tools and architecture are essential to speed up this process in a cost effective way. This paper presents how the development of a particular air operational scenario in an urban environment, according to the Simulation Interoperability Standard Organization (SISO) guide using M&S tools, can support the capability development process for future UAxS as well as their countermeasures. In particular, the M&S architecture was made of a federation of simulators interacting with real C2 systems. Several technologies were exploited, such as High Level Architecture (HLA), for simulation Run-Time Infrastructure; Artificial Intelligence (AI) ad-hoc developed modules, for robotic behavior; C2 – Simulation Interoperability (C2SIMI) language, for interoperation between simulators and C2 systems. The scenario was designed for addressing the challenges and countermeasures in the air domain operations concerning specifically facing an hostile swarm of Unmanned Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAaVs) attacking a critical infrastructure in a highly populated city. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) permeates society in many areas, such as automotive, smart-homes, smart-cities, healthcare, and critical infrastructures. Even if the IoT promises economic growth as well as convenience for users, the security (and safety) implications of the IoT are equally significant. In fact, weak security in IoT devices could have dangerous consequences, such as to a car crash, or an intruder entering in our home. As an example, in October 2016, the distributed denial of service attack on Dyn, a company controlling and managing several DNS services, brought down most of America’s Internet, and was caused by an IoT botnet (Mirai). This is mainly due to an increasing number of vulnerabilities in IoT devices being discovered on a daily basis, and that are the consequence of poor IoT security practices. To properly address the security and testing of IoT devices, the first step is the description of a threat model. However, few IoT manufactures base their testing on sound threat modelling techniques and comprehensive IoT security guidelines. For these reasons, in this paper we propose a methodological approach for IoT security testing, which extends the OWASP IoT framework to include threat models to guide the selection of tests used to evaluate IoT attack surfaces and associated vulnerabilities. In addition, the proposed extended framework includes indications on how to actually test a given vulnerability and a set of recommended tools for performing the tests. To this end, we have devised a set of procedures associated with the tests, e.g. accessing device hardware or resetting the device. We also describe a set of tests based on the framework we have performed on IoT devices to test their security. In particular, we have tested the framework on a home router, a relatively cheap baby monitor, and a pricey security system. The methodological testing of the devices reported that the baby monitor showed signs of inadequate security, the router patching any known vulnerabilities as expected from a well-known manufacturer, and the security system quashing any penetration testing attempts. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={Cyber-attacks and intrusions in cyber-physical control systems are, currently, difficult to reliably prevent. Knowing a system's vulnerabilities and implementing static mitigations is not enough, since threats are advancing faster than the pace at which static cyber solutions can counteract. Accordingly, the practice of cybersecurity needs to ensure that intrusion and compromise do not result in system or environment damage or loss. In a previous paper [2], we described the Cyberspace Security Econometrics System (CSES), which is a stakeholder-aware and economics-based risk assessment method for cybersecurity. CSES allows an analyst to assess a system in terms of estimated loss resulting from security breakdowns. In this paper, we describe two new related contributions: 1) We map the Cyberspace Security Econometrics System (CSES) method to the evaluation and mitigation steps described by the NIST Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, Special Publication 800-82r2. Hence, presenting an economics-based and stakeholder-aware risk evaluation method for the implementation of the NIST-SP-800-82 guide; and 2) We describe the application of this tailored method through the use of a fictitious example of a critical infrastructure system of an electric and gas utility. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this paper, we examine the security of different categories of IoT devices to understand their resilience under different security conditions for attackers. In particular, we analyse IoT robustness against attacks performed under two threat models, namely (i) physical access of the attacker, (ii) close proximity of the attacker (i.e., RFID and WiFi ranges). We discuss the results of the tests we performed on different categories of IoT devices, namely IP cameras, OFo bike locks, RFID-based smart-locks, and smart-home WiFi routers. The results show that most of IoT devices do not address basic vulnerabilities, which can be exploitable under different threat models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={With an immense number of threats pouring in from nation states and hacktivists as well as terrorists and cybercriminals, the requirement of a globally secure infrastructure becomes a major obligation. Most critical infrastructures were primarily designed to work isolated from the normal communication network, but due to the advent of the "Smart Grid" that uses advanced and intelligent approaches to control critical infrastructure, it is necessary for these cyber-physical systems to have access to the communication system. Consequently, such critical systems have become prime targets; hence security of critical infrastructure is currently one of the most challenging research problems. Performing an extensive security analysis involving experiments with cyber-attacks on a live industrial control system (ICS) is not possible. Therefore, researchers generally resort to test beds and complex simulations to answer questions related to SCADA systems. Since all conclusions are drawn from the test bed, it is necessary to perform validation against a physical model. This paper examines the fidelity of a virtual SCADA testbed to a physical test bed and allows for the study of the effects of cyber-attacks on both of the systems. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Industrial control systems rely more and more on digital technologies. Although the cyber risk such technologies induce is widely judged as serious, especially for critical infrastructures, these systems have generally not been designed to serve cybersecurity purposes. Instead they were thought first for serving operational efficiency. It thus becomes critical to study cyber threats in industrial environments and experimental test beds are needed to evaluate risks, physical consequences of cyber incidents, and performance of countermeasures. The test bed we present here focuses on studying cyber risks and their mitigation in IEC 61850 power utility automation systems. The operational part is composed of engineering computers, supervision software, off-the-shelf intelligent relays (Intelligent Electronic Device - IED), a hardware-in-the-loop process simulation, and the cybersecurity tools include an attack generation station and a network analyzer. In this paper, we present the operational part, giving details on the power grid hardware-in-the-loop simulation and its importance in the understanding of cyber consequences on the global system. The article concludes giving preliminary experimental results showing consequences of a false data injection attack on a simple electrical architecture. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, power grid monitoring systems are shifting towards more disseminating and distributive operations. The diagnosis of faults using knowledge discovery techniques has become an essential component of the process, accounting to the challenges faced by the electrical power monitoring systems. The system’s operators employ various energy management techniques which play important roles in the overall management, reliability and operational sustainability of smart grid utilities. Sometimes, these systems are disrupted by events like a short circuit in the system or any external incursion that could pose a threat to the public safety as well as to the critical infrastructure of the grid. This paper aims at providing a robust system for fault diagnosis using the status of an intelligent electronic device and circuit breakers which can be tripped by any kind of fault. To protect the system from vulnerabilities and different kinds of faults, a multilayered fault estimation classifier, based on the Dominance based rough set is proposed. This technique provides an effective solution to the system’s operator for the proper diagnosis of the faults and intrusions by classifying the state of the system. In addition to this, the operator can take preventative measures to protect the system from further damage. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Each scenario includes the target system and some threat agents that compose the attacks enabled by the system vulnerabilities to reach some predefined goals. The suite applies a Monte Carlo method with multiple simulations of the agent attacks against the target system. The simulation applies a formal model of the target system that describes the system nodes, the components with their vulnerabilities, and the logical topology. This paper proposes an extension to model in a more accurate way how the relations and the interactions among applications affect the agent attacks. After introducing this extension, we show how it supports the modeling of web applications. Then, we adopt the new model to assess a critical infrastructure that supervises and manages gas distribution. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Cybersecurity is among the highest priorities in industries, academia and governments. Cyber-threats information sharing among different organizations has the potential to maximize vulnerabilities discovery at a minimum cost. Cyber-threats information sharing has several advantages. First, it diminishes the chance that an attacker exploits the same vulnerability to launch multiple attacks in different organizations. Second, it reduces the likelihood an attacker can compromise an organization and collect data that will help him launch an attack on other organizations. Cyberspace has numerous interconnections and critical infrastructure owners are dependent on each other's service. This well-known problem of cyber interdependency is aggravated in a public cloud computing platform. The collaborative effort of organizations in developing a countermeasure for a cyber-breach reduces each firm's cost of investment in cyber defense. Despite its multiple advantages, there are costs and risks associated with cyber-threats information sharing. When a firm shares its vulnerabilities with others there is a risk that these vulnerabilities are leaked to the public (or to attackers) resulting in loss of reputation, market share and revenue. Therefore, in this strategic environment the firms committed to share cyber-threats information might not truthfully share information due to their own self-interests. Moreover, some firms acting selfishly may rationally limit their cybersecurity investment and rely on information shared by others to protect themselves. This can result in under investment in cybersecurity if all participants adopt the same strategy. This paper will use game theory to investigate when multiple self-interested firms can invest in vulnerability discovery and share their cyber-threat information. We will apply our algorithm to a public cloud computing platform as one of the fastest growing segments of the cyberspace. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The U.S. electric power grid consists of over 200,000 miles of highvoltage transmission lines and hundreds of large transformer substations. High voltage (HV) transformer units make up less than 3% of U.S. transformers, but they carry 60%-70% of the nation’s electricity. Because they serve as vital nodes, HV transformers are critical to the nation’s electric grid. HV transformers are also the most vulnerable to damage from malicious acts. For more than 10 years, the electric utility industry and government agencies have engaged in activities to secure HV transformers from physical attack and to improve recovery in the event of a successful attack. These activities include coordination and information sharing, spare equipment programs, security standards, security exercises, and other measures. There has been some level of physical security investment and an increasing refinement of voluntary security practices across the electric power sector for at least the last 15 years. However, recent grid security exercises, together with a 2013 physical attack on transformers in Metcalf, CA, have changed the way grid security is viewed and have focused congressional interest on the physical security of HV transformers. They have also prompted new grid security efforts by utilities and regulators. On November 20, 2014, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a new mandatory Physical Security Reliability Standard (CIP-014-1) proposed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The new standards require certain transmission owners “to address physical security risks and vulnerabilities related to the reliable operation” of the power grid by performing risk assessments to identify their critical facilities, evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities, and implement security plans to protect against attacks. Legislative proposals would expand federal efforts to prevent or recover from a physical attack on the U.S. grid. These include the Enhanced Grid Security Act of 2015 (S. 1241), the Critical Electric Infrastructure Protection Act (H.R. 2271), the Terrorism Prevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2015 (H.R. 85), a House bill to establish a strategic transformer reserve program (H.R. 2244), and the Grid Modernization Act of 2015 (S. 1243). There is widespread agreement among government agencies, utilities, and manufacturers that HV transformers in the United States are vulnerable to terrorist attack, and that such an attack potentially could have catastrophic consequences. But the most serious, multi-transformer attacks could require acquiring operational information and a certain level of sophistication on the part of potential attackers. Consequently, despite the technical arguments, without more specific information about potential targets and attacker capabilities, the actual risk of a multi-HV transformer attack remains an open question. As the electric power industry and federal agencies continue their efforts to improve the physical security of critical HV transformer substations, Congress may consider several issues as part of its oversight of the sector: identifying critical transformers, confidentiality of critical transformer information, adequacy of HV transformer protection, quality of federal threat information, recovery from HV transformer attacks, and the overall resiliency of the grid. Maintaining an integrated perspective on prevention, recovery, and resilience may help to promote an effective balance among industry investment, regulatory requirements, and federal oversight. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) are highly distributed information systems used to control and monitor critical infrastructures such as nuclear plants, power generation and distribution plants, Oil and Gas and many other facilities. The main architecture principles of ICS are; real time response, high availability and reliability. For these specific purposes, several protocols has been designed to ensure the control and supervision operations. Modbus and DNP3 are the most used protocols in the ICS world due to their compliance with real time needs. With the increasing of the connectivity to the internet world for business reasons, ICS adopted Internet based technologies and most of communication protocols are redesigned to work over IP. This openness exposed the ICS components as well as communication protocols to cyber-attacks with a higher risk than attacks on traditional IT systems. In order to facilitate the risk assessment of cyber-attacks on ICS protocols we propose a taxonomy model of different identified attacks on Modbus and DNP3.the model is based on the threat origin, threat type, attack type, attack scenario, vulnerability type and the impact of the attack. We populate this Taxonomy model with identified attacks on Modbus and DNP3 from previous academic and industrial works. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The information and communications technology (ICT) industry has evolved greatly over the last half century. The technology is ubiquitous and increasingly integral to almost every facet of modern society. ICT devices and components are generally interdependent, and disruption of one may affect many others. Over the past several years, experts and policy makers have expressed increasing concerns about protecting ICT systems from cyberattacks, which many experts expect to increase in frequency and severity over the next several years. The act of protecting ICT systems and their contents has come to be known as cybersecurity. A broad and arguably somewhat fuzzy concept, cybersecurity can be a useful term but tends to defy precise definition. It is also sometimes inappropriately conflated with other concepts such as privacy, information sharing, intelligence gathering, and surveillance. However, cybersecurity can be an important tool in protecting privacy and preventing unauthorized surveillance, and information sharing and intelligence gathering can be useful tools for effecting cybersecurity. The management of risk to information systems is considered fundamental to effective cybersecurity. The risks associated with any attack depend on three factors: threats (who is attacking), vulnerabilities (how they are attacking), and impacts (what the attack does). Most cyberattacks have limited impacts, but a successful attack on some components of critical infrastructure (CI)-most of which is held by the private sector-could have significant effects on national security, the economy, and the livelihood and safety of individual citizens. Reducing such risks usually involves removing threat sources, addressing vulnerabilities, and lessening impacts. The federal role in cybersecurity involves both securing federal systems and assisting in protecting nonfederal systems. Under current law, all federal agencies have cybersecurity responsibilities relating to their own systems, and many have sector-specific responsibilities for CI. On average, federal agencies spend more than 10% of their annual ICT budgets on cybersecurity. More than 50 statutes address various aspects of cybersecurity, and new legislation has been debated since at least the 111th Congress. Executive Order 13636 and Presidential Policy Directive 21, released in February 2013, address the cybersecurity of CI through voluntary public/private sector collaboration and use of existing regulatory authorities. Four bills enacted in December 2014 address the security of federal ICT, the cybersecurity workforce at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and DHS information-sharing activities. Other bills would address information sharing more broadly, research and development, protection of CI, notification of victims of data breaches, and cybercrime laws, among other issues. The executive-branch actions and proposed legislation are largely designed to address several well-established near-term needs in cybersecurity. However, those needs exist in the context of more difficult long-term challenges relating to design, incentives, consensus, and environment. Legislation and executive actions in the 114th Congress could have significant impacts on those challenges. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICSs) are an important part of critical infrastructure in cyberspace. They are especially vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their legacy hardware and software and the difficulty of changing it. We first survey the history of intrusions into ICSs, the more serious of which involved a continuing adversary presence on an ICS network. We discuss some common vulnerabilities and the categories of possible attacks, noting the frequent use of software written a long time ago. We propose a framework for designing ICS incident response under the constraints that no new software must be required and that interventions cannot impede the continuous processing that is the norm for such systems. We then discuss a prototype toolkit we built using the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-Line tool for host-based analysis and the Bro intrusion-detection software for network-based analysis. Particularly useful techniques we used were learning the historical range of parameters of numeric quantities so as to recognize anomalies, learning the usual addresses of connections to a node, observing Internet addresses (usually rare), observing anomalous network protocols such as unencrypted data transfers, observing unusual scheduled tasks, and comparing key files through registry entries and hash values to find malicious modifications. We tested our methods on actual data from ICSs including publicly-available data, voluntarily-submitted data, and researcher-provided "advanced persistent threat" data. We found instances of interesting behavior in our experiments. Intrusions were generally easy to see because of the repetitive nature of most processing on ICSs, but operators need to be motivated to look. © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={The increasing application of information and communication technologies (ICT) to industrial control systems has improved the scalability and flexibility of these systems, enabling the possibility to access them from external nodes. However, in many cases, the evolution of these elements has exposed industrial control systems (ICS) to a series of threats for which they are usually unprepared. These systems are currently found not only in industrial settings but also in all kinds of critical infrastructures. For that reason, it is essential to promote education in the field of cybersecurity for industrial control systems, being hands-on experience the most important aspect. In this work, we present a remote laboratory that enables performing cybersecurity tests on real industrial control elements. This platform consists of a test environment that has been added to our remote laboratory of automatic control (LRA-ULE), and lets students work with industrial equipment used in real installations such as PLCs, gateways or electrical meters. The communications architecture is based on a three-layer structure (physical, server and client layer), which is also used in the rest of the LRA-ULE platform. Moreover, a web-based front-end to interact with the system and a set of practical tasks have been developed, so that students can learn to configure and run a vulnerability scanner or to interpret vulnerability reports. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Integrated water resources management provides an often-recommended governance framework to manage water resources in a sustainable way. The application of this framework on Transboundary Rivers brings additional challenges, which can be exacerbated due to climate changes and extremes (such as droughts). These changes affect the operation of water infrastructures and will affect water management practices. Thus, the understanding and development of adaptation measures (across socio-economic, environmental and administrative systems) are critical, mainly on drought prone transboundary river basins. The paper draws on research conducted to 1) assess climatic risks in those watersheds, 2) describe the challenges in water resources management in the context of climate change, and 3) draw lessons for improving the use of research-based information. Two case studies were selected, the Colorado River Basin (North America) and the Guadiana River (Iberian Peninsula), the latter of which in the context of the five river basins shared between Portugal and Spain. Research and experience in these Basins show that several paradoxes in multistate water management and governance across borders militate against the accurate assessment of socio-economic impacts and the effective use of scientific information for meeting short-term needs in reducing longer-term vulnerabilities. Lessons drawn from both studies, but not always learned in practice, abound. These lessons include an expanded use of incentives for improving collaboration, water-use efficiency, demand management and for the development of climate services to inform water-related management as new threats arise. Recommendations are established for more effectively linking risk assessment approaches with resilience strategies that are applicable in practice and available to decision makers in a changing climate. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Over the last 25 years we have seen a massive change in how we manage and think about information. The Internet is a rather new technology for us, but nevertheless it has become a force that is working its way into all our lives and there is no doubt in this. However it is important to realize the security issues involving it. In the 1980s the information was mostly stored and used in analogue form, as it was stored on papers, binders, shelves and safes. Today almost all information is digital. It is created and stored on individual computers and transmitted over computer networks. From the security point of view, this means that the information sent, often secret or private, can now be intercepted from anywhere over the planet. This has strong consequences because now we no longer have to be physically where the data is. Cyber security has emerged within the latest years as an issue of vital importance for everyone as governments, businesses and individuals are under constant attack from other governments, cyber criminals and hackers. These attacks steal large amount of money, in form of personal-business data, and compromise sensitive government operations. Industrial software and equipment represents a new attack vector for our modern industry that involves both the risk of unintentional employee errors as well as aimed attacks. Attack types such as social engineering, port scanning, packet sniffing, password cracking, denial of service attacks, machine bugs, server bugs and exploits are no longer targeted for the desktop and server environments only as they are becoming a real threat for all non-IT industries. This makes work harder even for security specialists and researchers, as these directions are new and have not been yet properly evaluated. Since almost every critical infrastructure like transportations systems, automotive factories, telecommunication, water supply and electricity generation has a computer network for decision-making and control in the background, this is vulnerable to a series of threats. This chapter is focused on these threats with accent on new forms of it, more exactly the issues about industrial control systems like SCADA, which are configured to control and monitor specific industrial processes, with a case study on Stuxnet. State of the art vulnerabilities like car viruses are also covered. For in-depth understanding of the concept involved in cyber security we have included some attack scenarios explained in detail. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Chapter Overview: All critical infrastructures are dependent on computer information infrastructures for management, control, and communications. The government defines a critical infrastructure as, systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety (DHS 2012). Critical information infrastructure (CII) facilities use special equipment to control or manage telecommunications, air transportation, the financial sector, the electric power grid and many other services important for the economy and daily activity. Cyber attacks against these and other critical infrastructure facilities can potentially disrupt services over widespread areas and long times. Critical infrastructure equipment systems have unique security vulnerabilities that can make them appear to be relatively easy targets for cyber espionage or cyber sabotage. Examples of cyber attacks aimed at CII facility equipment vulnerabilities include malicious computer programs called Flame and Stuxnet, which were reportedly created by the U.S. and Israel for cyber espionage and sabotage against critical nuclear industrial facilities in Iran. In the U.S., officials have expressed warnings that cyber attacks by nations, criminals, or extremists and terrorists could soon overtake traditional violent terrorist attacks as the top threat to U.S. National Security (Nakashima, Senate Ready to take up cybersecurity bill that critics say is too weak, 2012). This chapter explores emerging cyberterrorism threats to critical information infrastructures. There is discussion of the special cyber vulnerabilities found in industrial control systems that operate critical infrastructure facilities. These special vulnerabilities help make important critical infrastructures look like easy targets for possible cyberterrorist attacks. This is followed by a description of malicious zero-day exploits, which provide sophisticated stealth characteristics that can help to secretly insert malicious code into critical infrastructure systems for espionage and for cyber sabotage. Hackers and cyber experts may knowingly or unknowingly sell these zero-day exploits and malicious code to extremists or terrorist groups. Governments and businesses may also use the stealth features of zero-day exploit code to insert malicious cyber code into critical infrastructures of businesses or nations which may later be activated for cyber sabotage. As Western governments continue to use pre-emptive cyber strikes to enforce unilateral policy decisions, this may encourage retaliatory cyberattacks from extremists or terrorists that target critical infrastructures in the West. Analysis of the code for Flame and Stuxnet has been shared widely among teams of researchers and teams of hackers in several countries, and copies of the code have become an open repository for re-usable malicious technology. It is likely that extremists and terrorists may now also have access to copies of the malicious technologies available in this repository that can be used as models for future cyberterrorist attacks directed against critical infrastructures in Western nations. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

abstract={Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) relates to the challenges posed by 'High Impact, Low Frequency Risks'.1World-wide critical infrastructure interdependencies also exist across the globe.2 The risk of a coordinated cyber, physical, or blended attack against CIP systems has become more acute over the past 15 years as digital communicating equipment has introduced cyber vulnerability to the system, and resource optimization trends have allowed some inherent physical redundancy within the system to be reduced. The specific concern with respect to these threats is the targeting of multiple key nodes on the system that, if damaged, destroyed, or interrupted in a coordinated fashion, could bring the system outside the protection provided by traditional planning and operating criteria. Such an attack would behave very differently than traditional risks to the system in that an intelligent attacker could mount an adaptive attack that would manipulate assets and potentially provide misleading information to system operators attempting to address the issue. More comprehensive work is needed, however, to realize the vision of a secure CIP system. Better technology solutions for the cyber portion of the threat needs to be developed, with specific focus on forensic tools and network architectures to support graceful system degradation that would allow operators to "fly with fewer controls." Component and system design criteria also need to be re-evaluated with respect to these threats with an eye toward designing for survivability. Prioritization of key assets for protection will be a critical component of a successful mitigation approach. Consequently, there needs to be a significant shift in industry specific standards by referencing active security monitoring, security intelligence and specially designed forensics tools. The review will address the latest developments in information protection, threat mitigation, behavioural and intrusion detection, situational awareness and defending against advanced persistent threats (APT's)3. The global oil and gas businesses cannot close their eyes to this threat and hope it will go away or won't happen to them. They must begin defending themselves now against the Perfect Storm 4 5 6 7 8Copyright 2014, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are of the most important components of National Critical Infrastructure. They can provide control capabilities in complex systems of critical importance such as energy production and distribution, transportation, telecoms etc. Protection of such systems is the cornerstone of essential service provision with resilience and in timely manner. Effective risk management methods form the basis for the protection of an Industrial Control System. However, the nature of ICSs render traditional risk management methods insufficient. The proprietary character and the complex interrelationships of the various systems that form an ICS, the potential impacts outside its boundaries, along with emerging trends such as the exposure to the Internet, necessitate revisiting traditional risk management methods, in a way that treat an ICS as a system-of-systems rather than a single, one-off entity. Towards this direction, in this paper we present enhancements to the traditional risk management methods at the phase of risk assessment, by utilising the cybernetic construct of the Viable System Model (VSM) as a means towards a holistic view of the risks against Critical Infrastructure. For the purposes of our research, utilising VSM’s recursive nature, we model the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, a most commonly used ICS, as a VSM and identify the various assets, interactions with the internal and external environment, threats and vulnerabilities. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.},

abstract={Originally isolated by design, Critical Infrastructures (CI) based on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) - such as SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems - were born within the scope of industrial process control technologies. Having evolved from proprietary systems, ICS eventually started adopting open architectures and standards, becoming increasingly interconnected with existing corporate networking infrastructures and even the Internet. However, as these systems overcame their isolation and moved towards interconnected topologies, they also became more exposed to threats that weren't even remotely conceivable when they were first designed. Particularly, cyber-threats are one of the most significant problems that modern ICS face, as the shortcomings and vulnerabilities of the decade-old ICS technology - some of them known for a long time, but mostly downplayed due to the isolation of such systems - become serious threats that can ultimately compromise human lives. As the security needs ICT and ICS domains cannot be addressed in the same way, this calls for a domain-specific approach to cyber threat detection, designed from scratch to address its particular needs. It must consider the particular characteristics of each networking context, be it ICS or ICT, in order to provide realtime cyber-security awareness for the security teams operating in the control room - this is one of the most important contributions of the CockpitCI FP7 project (http://CockpitCI.eu), which aims at improving the resilience and dependability of CIs. In this paper we present the CockpitCI cyber-detection and analysis layer, also including a detailed description of its most relevant components in terms of role, integration and remote management. This paper will also show how the proposed solution might be effective in dealing with such cyber-threats, by presenting relevant examples.},

abstract={In the last ten years, an efficient Security Management System (SEMS) has acquired an important role for organizations working in transportation sector. In many cases, Critical Infrastructure legislation plans specific and mandatory quality requirements for the implementation of a security management system. The organizations are encouraged by the legislative requirements and the competitiveness to certify the SEMS in accordance with the current international standards (e.g. ISO 27001 and ISO 28000). As well known, certification can be either a mandatory or a voluntary process but it is usually voluntary and qualitative. In the SEMS, as in other management systems, current certification uses a qualitative approach deriving from the ISO 9000. Normally in certification, quantitative assessment characterizes only some technological systems while every other application including human factor or procedures uses qualitative assessment. The development of security management system certification should bring to introducing risk-based and quantitative assessment methods. Benefits arising from the residual risk quantification of the SEMS can set certification a tool enabling to bargain with insurances, a warranty for the investments undertaken when facing stakeholders and shareholders, a proof to justify decisions during a legal action and last but not least a good publicity for company's image and hence company's competitiveness. This paper proposes the implementation of risk-based methodologies in use by process engineering to achieve a quantitative assessment of security management systems. The methodology is exposed and applied to a railway case study. The first steps show how to analyze the system (study of macro operability functions, identification of subsystems, etc.) and how to integrate technological, human and procedural aspects by flow charts. The later steps describe how to manage threats, vulnerability and criticality of Critical Infrastructure subsystems and how to identify "primary causes" and "Top Event consequences" drawing fault trees and event trees, and finally how to calculate the residual risk for security management system. In conclusion, the methodology is applied on a case study of one railway subsystem and the results of the quantitative risk analysis are exposed. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={In most of high seismic zones parts of the world, limited knowledge on the heterogeneity in landform changes and geological formation causes threat from natural hazards disasters to the population. In absence of hazard resilient coherent long-term management policies, disasters result due to human failure to introduce proper preparedness measures, and tendency to manage vulnerability and risks by ad hoc and tactical approaches. To manage, prevent or mitigate hazards, efforts should be reoriented and consolidated to educate all stakeholders (including politicians, policy-makers and public) that they have to consider ‘Geo-diversity’ in their choices, and how they can overcome impacts by critical analysis of geo-ethical dilemmas, guided by the choices from the Geo-techniques based best obtainable detailed scientific information, and socio-economical considerations. Efforts by reliable, competent, capable and transparent institutions, to characterize the geo-regime spatiotemporal variability by integrated disciplinary approach, can help to harness the ‘Geo-diversity’ and ensure proper search and selection of the location of sites for planning the construction and maintenance of infrastructures. For better preparedness strategies, management plans and policies, discouraging corrupt and unscrupulous practices for private gain, can help to enhance efficiency and promote harmony by individuals trust, knowledge, transparency, respect of interests, share of responsibility and resources. This critical subject matter on how to harness the geo-diversity to combat hazard has been discussed here, through broader implications of an example of hazards and disasters in North India. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a solid understanding, policy and action recommendations to motivate and capacitate more cities to start such urban vulnerability processes and to guide them in their first steps in a direction which will more easily allow the direct use of vulnerability assessments for subsequent adaptation and resilience planning. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology adopted for this assessment builds on several years of ICLEI's international experience in climate change adaptation work. It specifically draws on the urban vulnerability component of the ICLEI ACCCRN process, a toolkit developed with support from Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network program, by ICLEI South Asia in partnership with ICLEI Oceania. A participatory approach that includes all key stakeholders and builds on past or ongoing relevant work in the city, as well as draws on existing data sources were adopted in view of the limited timeframe of this study (five months). A stakeholder consultation methodology referred to as Shared Learning Dialogues (SLDs) was adopted to engage not only various departments within the city government but also other local stakeholders. SLDs facilitate multi dimensional information sharing with everyone contributing information and experiences, and everyone learning from the exchanges as well. Findings: The critical impacts have been identified through a series of participatory learning processes which were corroborated with existing secondary data and baseline studies, where available. During SLD process, a timeline exercise was carried out and the consequences of those climatic hazards were also chalked out. Subsequently, these identified impacts were justified broadly with the available data and studies. These are saline water intrusion, loss of assets and infrastructure, health impacts - increased morbidity, water supply contaminated, sanitation and drainage systems disrupted, heightened threat situation (fear of embankment breach), in-migration, increasing siltation in the canals, river bank encroachment, livelihood change, biodiversity loss. Practical implications: The resilience interventions identified by the stakeholders can be assessed for potential linkages with existing or planned schemes, followed by supporting sectoral and pre-feasibility studies, resulting finally in the identification of financing options. These actions can be focussed on the vulnerable areas within the cities, especially hotspots, and social groups identified and their adaptive capacities were assessed. Originality/value: The resilience interventions identified by the stakeholders provides a focussed starting point for further discussion in terms of refinement of these actions as well their prioritization according to resilience and feasibility (economic, social, environmental) criteria. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS) monitor and control industrial processes, and enable automation in industry facilities. Many of these facilities are regarded as Critical Infrastructures (CIs). Due to the increasing use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) IT products and connectivity offerings, CIs have become an attractive target for cyber-attacks. A successful attack could have significant consequences. An important step in securing Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) against cyber-attacks is risk analysis - understanding security risks, based on a systematic analysis of information on vulnerabilities, cyber threats, and the impacts related to the targeted system. Existing risk analysis approaches have various limitations, such as scalability and practicability problems. In contrast to previous work, we propose a practical and vulnerability-centric risk analysis approach for determining security risks associated with advanced, multi-step cyber-attacks. In order to examine multi-step attacks that exploit chains of vulnerabilities, we map vulnerabilities into preconditions and effects, and use rule-based reasoning for identifying advanced attacks and their path through a CII. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS) monitor and control operations associated with the national critical infrastructure (e.g., electric power grid, oil and gas pipelines and water treatment facilities). These systems rely on technologies and architectures that were designed for system reliability and availability. Security associated with ICS was never an inherent concern, primarily due to the protections afforded by network isolation. However, a trend in ICS operations is to migrate to commercial networks via TCP/IP in order to leverage commodity benefits and cost savings. As a result, system vulnerabilities are now exposed to the online community. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that many exposed ICS devices are being discovered using readily available applications (e.g., ShodanHQ search engine and Google-esque queries). Due to the lack of security and logging capabilities for ICS, most knowledge about attacks are derived from real world incidents after an attack has already been carried out and the damage has been done. This research provides a method for introducing sensors into the ICS environment that collect information about network-based attacks. The sensors are developed using an inexpensive Gumstix platform that can be deployed and incorporated with production systems. Data obtained from the sensors provide insight into attack tactics (e.g., port scans, Nessus scans, Metasploit modules, and zero-day exploits) and characteristics (e.g., attack origin, frequency, and level of persistence). Findings enable security professionals to draw an accurate, real-time awareness of the threats against ICS devices and help shift the security posture from reactionary to preventative. © 2013 SPIE.},

abstract={With the rapid development of information and automatic control technology, more and more industrial control system(ICS) like SCADA, is interconnected with Ethernet and directly connected to internet, which greatly improve the efficiency of data sharing and introduced in security threats at the same time. As the important components of critical infrastructure, if attacked, will behave abnormal and result in disasters to society countries and national economy. As one of the most import industrial protocols applied widely in the industry field, OPC is responsible to provide producing related data to HMI and database gathered from field devices like PLC and RTU. Because of the unique nature of industrial control system, traditional fuzzing technology cannot be applied to vulnerability detecting of OPC protocols directly. So it is urgent to develop a novel fuzzing technology for OPC protocol. This paper first described motivation of vulnerability detecting for OPC with fuzzing tool, then introduced the design and implementation of fuzzing technology for OPC protocol, the structure, workflow and algorithm is also described in detail. Finally, a experiment for OPC protocol fuzzing is proposed and the result is analyzed, some conclusion can be reached that the fuzzing technology proposed in this paper can fully satisfy the requirement of vulnerability detecting of OPC protocol. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Today, almost every environment (e.g. airports, home, office, etc.) are populated with a high number of heterogeneous devices like smart-phones, sensors, laptops, tablets or hotspots. Taking advantage of the different communications capabilities that these devices have researches have been studying how to make people collaborate in spontaneous or dynamic groups to sharing photos, discuss topics, among others. However, this plethora of devices sharing "something" opens the doors to new potential threats putting in risk important personal data or misuse of device resources. Therefore, these environments require new mechanisms able to ensure that devices are conducted safely, and that are able to detect and inform about any anomalies that might occur during an interaction. Although vulnerabilities currently present in ubiquitous devices are quite similar to those in personal computers. The attention given to improve safety has not been enough, especially in the case of malware in mobiles devices, which has been overlooked, mainly due to the large number of malware samples, the sophistication in obfuscation techniques and the internet access constraints which make detection techniques such as those based on signatures, not sufficient. Thus, in this work we analyse current techniques for detecting unwanted data in pervasive environments, and introduce new approaches that model the behaviour among devices in order to detect anomalies related to two scenarios: critical infrastructures and smartphone devices. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2012.},

But it's not the easiest system to use, which can undermine its security benefits. Active Directory is a core component of the network infrastructure of many organisational networks and is crucial for the internal security of the network by mitigating internal threats. However, managing it is often a complex, time-consuming task. Configuration errors can lead to serious security vulnerabilities. Organisations should look for addon tools that automate many of the processes involved and that ease many of the management pains and complexity. These will streamline many processes, and ensure changes do not impact the overall security posture of the organisation, explains Colin Tankard of Digital Pathways. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The cyber-security of industrial control systems (ICS) is gaining high relevance due to the impact of industrial system failures on the citizen life. There is an urgent need for the consideration of security in their design, and for the analysis of the related vulnerabilities and potential threats. The high exposure of industrial critical infrastructure to cyber-threats is mainly due to the intrinsic weakness of the communication protocols used to control the process network. The peculiarities of the industrial protocols (low computational power, large geographical distribution, near to real-time constraints) make hard the effective use of traditional cryptographic schemes and in particular the implementation of an effective key management infrastructure supporting a cryptographic layer. In this paper, we describe a "model of distributed key generation for industrial control systems" we have recently implemented. The model is based on a known Distributed Key Generator protocol we have adapted to an industrial control system environment and to the related communication protocol (Modbus). To validate in a formal way selected security properties of the model, we introduced a Petri Nets representation. This representation allows for modeling attacks against the protocol and understanding some potential weaknesses of its implementation in the industrial control system environment.},

abstract={The Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental and critical building block of the Internet. Not only, DNS represents one of the most critical services of information infrastructures, and the strong interdependency between critical infrastructures relying on information and communication technology makes DNS a likely, disrupting target in case of cyber conflict. Critical infrastructures are no longer independent from the Internet networks: electricity plants, telecommunications services, transportation systems, banks and financial institutions heavily rely on Information and Communication Technology (ICT). New risk scenarios for critical infrastructure protection are expected, in that newer threats propagate through the Internet networks and exploit Internet infrastructure vulnerabilities, making such threats as cyber espionage, cyber conflict and cyber terrorism a likely possibility every government should consider in its national security agenda. DNS is vulnerable to a series of threat agents, and these vulnerabilities might be exploited by coordinated groups of attackers to produce damages to national critical assets. A more secure DNS in terms of technology, processes, policy making and organizational structures is needed. The proposal presented in this paper represents a work in progress, whose main objective consists in the development of an accepted metric framework for DNS security and stability: this will be accomplished through a deep state-of-theart analysis of current DNS metrics and KPIs, the proposal of a newer set of KPIs and consequential sharing of the results with the DNS community. We believe the definition and collection of these metrics will pave the way to the empirical definition of a DNS stability baseline, leading to the establishment of best practices, standards and acceptable service levels for a consolidated overarching DNS security policy making framework and raising awareness on DNS vulnerabilities and threats outside DNS community.},

abstract={A primary mission of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, Department) is to " prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism, and minimize the damage, and assist in the recovery from terrorist attacks that do occur in the United States." Since its inception in 2003, DHS has had an intelligence component to support this mission and has been a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). Following a major reorganization of the DHS (called the Second Stage Review, or " 2SR" ) in July 2005, former Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, established a strengthened Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and made the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis (now Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis) the Chief Intelligence Officer for the Department. He also tasked I&A with ensuring that intelligence is coordinated, fused, and analyzed within the Department to provide a common operational picture; provide a primary connection between DHS and the IC as a whole; and to act as a primary source of information for state, local, and private sector partners. Congress made information sharing a top priority of the Department's intelligence component in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and underscored that importance through the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Since the 2SR reorganization, Congress imposed additional requirements for intelligence analysis; information sharing; department-wide intelligence integration; and support to state, local, tribal governments, and the private sector through the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. At the outset of the new Administration, the DHS Intelligence (DHSI) enterprise consists of I&A, two headquarters elements supported by I&A, and the intelligence elements of six DHS operational components: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and U.S. Secret Service (USSS). As the Obama Administration fills key positions within DHS and I&A, Congress will likely be interested in the progress of integration of the Department's intelligence components and the quality and relevance of the intelligence DHSI produces for front line law enforcement and security officials who are responsible for protecting America and its people. In addition, this year, the Department will produce its first Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR), a comprehensive assessment that outlines its long-term strategy and priorities for homeland security and guidance on the Department's programs, assets, capabilities, budget, policies, and authorities. The results of the QHSR will be particularly important as Congress considers an authorization bill for the Department. This report provides an overview of DHSI both at headquarters and within the components. It examines how DHSI is organized and supports key departmental activities to include homeland security analysis and threat warning; border security; critical infrastructure protection; and support to, and the sharing of information with, state, local, tribal, and private sector partners. It also discusses several oversight challenges and options that Congress may consider on certain issues. This report may be updated. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

In addition, the paper carries out a complete review of current methodologies, software applications and modelling techniques around critical infrastructure protection in accordance with their functionality in a risk management framework.The study of threats and vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure systems shows two important trends in methodologies and modelling. A first trend relates to the identification of methods, techniques, tools and diagrams to describe the current state of infrastructure.

abstract={As an original member of the Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) that developed the "Recommendations for Bridge and Tunnel Security" published in September 2003 by the Federal Highway Administration and AASHTO the author reviews the use of this and other subsequent homeland security related risk assessment guidelines in practice by sharing observations on how threat and vulnerability assessment (TVA) of existing bridges has evolved and where it may be going. The paper focuses on the original objectives of the BRP recommendations, how they align with the latest National Infrastructure Protection Plans for the Transportation Sector, how well their application has worked in practice, whether they assist DOTs and other agencies in obtaining DHS grant funding for security related projects, their application to rail bridges and tunnels, and why they are an essential part in the decision making process for implementing security improvements and countermeasures for bridges and tunnels. This will be discussed in the context of a case study. Since the BRP recommendations were issued best practices for TVAs conducted by some state DOTs have given way to simplified decision tables for risk equations and risk values used with electronic spread sheets that can be used to sort security mitigation costs for critical bridges using cost-benefit factors. The prioritized mitigation projects for existing bridges are then included in the rehabilitation project scope for each bridge when they are contracted out based upon the DOT's state-ofgood- repair program. Many states, however, have not yet embraced the BRP recommendations based upon the judgment that funds for repairing deficient bridges are their first priority and they will not deal with security related issues until those needs are addressed. Independent of the availability of funds to repair or secure bridges in a given state or agency, there is a need to prioritize the criticality of the bridge and tunnel inventory because whether a bridge fails due to deterioration, an accident, natural hazards, or intentional attack, the owner should know where the first dollar of funding should be spent, be it for repair of deficiencies or for hazard reduction. © ASCE 2011.},

abstract={The study of the interdependencies within critical infrastructures (CI) is a growing field of research as the importance of potential failure propagation among infrastructures may lead to cascades affecting all supply networks. New powerful methods are required to model and describe such systems-of-systems (SoS) as a whole. An overall model is required to provide security and reliability assessment taking into account various kinds of threats and failures. A significant challenge associated with this model may be to create what-if scenarios for the analysis of interdependencies. In this paper the interdependencies between industrial control systems (ICS), in particular SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), and the underlying critical infrastructures to address the vulnerabilities related to the coupling of these systems are analyzed. The modeling alternatives for system-of-systems, integrated versus coupled models, are discussed. An integrated model contains detailed low level models of (sub)systems as well as a high level model, covering all hierarchical levels. On the other hand, a coupled model aggregates different simulated outputs of the low level models as inputs at a higher level. Strengths and weaknesses of both approaches are analyzed and a model architecture for SCADA and the system under control are proposed. Furthermore, the HLA simulation standard is introduced and discussed in this paper as a promising approach to represent interdependencies between infrastructures. To demonstrate the capabilities of the HLA standard for the interdependencies study, an exemplary application and some first results are also briefly presented in this paper. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nation's network infrastructure such as the Global Information Grid (GIG) for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the OneNet for the Homeland Security Department are tran-sitioning to the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) per DoD CIO Memorandum of June 2003 and the Office of Management and Budget memorandum OMB-05-22. There exist IPv6 specific security vulnerabilities in these network infrastructures that need to be mitigated in order to achieve security parity with the existing IPv4 operations. From the perspective of the Homeland Security technologies, the existence of additional security vulnerabilities implies a possibility for two pronged threats. First, the IPv6 specific vulnerabilities reduce the security posture of the network infrastructure itself; second, other critical infrastructure sectors that depend on IPv6 need additional protection. For example, the future supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) industrial capabilities would increasingly use the IPv6 infrastructure, as would the voice communications, the voice and video collaboration, and sharing of data such as the image data and surveillance and reconnaissance data. This paper presents three contiguous results. First, it briefly presents the new IPv6 capabilities; second, it presents a brief analysis of the security vulnerabilities arising from these capabilities; and third, it presents a new security model for IPv6 network infrastructures that has the potential to mitigate these vulnerabilities. The new model is based on the end-to-end connectivity that is restored in IPv6, thus allowing the use of host based security (HBS) systems together with the perimeter security devices. However, the use of HBS complicates the security trust management. Therefore the third component of the model is introduced, namely a policy based security management (PBSM) approach. The PBSM approach allows the secure deployment of the host based security systems. It provides the capabilities needed to specify the trust zones via a set of security policy rules that together specify a trust zone. Hosts belong to one or more trust zones. Accordingly, the host based security policies are derived from the zone security policies for all the zones to which a host belongs. In addition, the PBSM approach has the potential to support more sophisticated security capabilities such as a risk adaptive access control and dynamic security response to a changing operational picture. The capabilities are needed to enable net-centric security operations. © 2010 IEEE.},

Cyber security assessment was conducted on ICS (Industrial control systems) of different companies for a period of four years and several vulnerabilities were identified. Main problems included use of weak encryption, standard protocols and information disclosure using unencrypted communication among ICS hosts on the network. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, a hacker could alter the communication between ICS and controlled equipment, resulting in malfunction. Overcoming these vulnerabilities is essential in order to protect the vital power sector in any country of the world.

abstract={Since about fifteen years, particularly since 9-11-2001 terrorist attack against New York World Wide Centre, industrial countries have progressively made an inventory of their respective critical infrastructures, in order to protect them. At the same time, a growing number of academic articles on the subject of critical infrastructures where published, mainly inside Anglo-Saxon reviews. So, this new subject became quickly imperative, both in the USA and in Europe, as at a practical level as at a theoretical one; and it contributed to a large extent to bring new thoughts about industrialised society vulnerability. Nevertheless, beyond the idea that critical infrastructures are essential and vital for the nations and their populations, the concept has never had a precise and shared definition. On the contrary, it has had and still has diverse meanings and implicit or explicit definitions, whether it is used inside a country or another, or even whether it is used by a researcher or one another. One of the reasons of this fact is that the ways risks for the populations (terrorist threats, natural or technological risks, disruptions inside networks, etc.) are classified into variable hierarchies would lead to variables lists of critical infrastructures, and also to different solutions to protect them. This is why the general concept of critical infrastructure must be criticized, so as to clarify a few misunderstandings about its meanings on the one hand, and so as to show on the other hand the innovations it brought however, particularly when speaking of new networks vulnerabilities.},

abstract={Modern Critical Infrastructures (CIs) (power grids, power plants, gas and oil pipelines, etc.) are strongly interconnected at the national and international levels nowadays. The failure of one of them can originate cascading effects which might have a serious and disastrous impact on others, even on geographically far infrastructures. The exchange of information about vulnerabilities, threats and countermeasures among the different actors of such interleaved systems assumes a not negligible role in the prevention of continental disasters. Due to its intrinsic nature, such information has to be considered strongly confidential and sensitive. Coping with the need for information sharing, preserving confidentiality according to some criteria, is a big obstacle in the creation of effective CI information sharing networks. In this paper, we present an extension of the well-known Trust-X negotiation framework which allows addressing of the confidentiality problem in the context of information sharing for CIs.

abstract={Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) against potential threats has become a major issue in modern society. CIP involves a set of multidisciplinary activities and requires the adoption of proper protection mechanisms, usually supervised by centralized monitoring systems. This paper presents the motivation, the working principles and the software architecture of DETECT (DEcision Triggering Event Composer & Tracker), a new framework aimed at the automatic and early detection of threats against critical infrastructures. The framework is based on the fact that non trivial attack scenarios are made up by a set of basic steps which have to be executed in a predictable sequence (with possible variants). Such scenarios are identified during Vulnerability Assessment which is a fundamental phase of the Risk Analysis for critical infrastructures. DETECT operates by performing a model-based logical, spatial and temporal correlation of basic events detected by the sensorial subsystem (possibly including intelligent video-surveillance, wireless sensor networks, etc.). In order to achieve this aim, DETECT is based on a detection engine which is able to reason about heterogeneous data, implementing a centralized application of "data fusion". The framework can be interfaced with or integrated in existing monitoring systems as a decision support tool or even to automatically trigger adequate countermeasures. © Taylor & Francis Group, London.© 2009 Taylor & Francis Group.},

The contribution of this work is a creation of a set of exploratory simulation models that help investigate the impact of various policy measures on the security of major stakeholders involved in CIKR protection. We show that under certain circumstances, all stakeholders benefit from more cost-effective CIKR risk management through sharing of information related to CIKR threats and vulnerabilities of CIKR owners.

abstract={Over the past two-to-three hundred years, humanity's ecological footprint has ballooned to such an extent that we are now fundamentally altering the planet. We have transformed the Earth's land surface and altered the function of its ecosystems, and we are triggering the rapid loss of both terrestrial and marine life. We are also profoundly changing our planet's climate. It is increasingly apparent that the breadth and depth of the changes we are wreaking on the environment are imperiling not only many of the other species with which we share the ecological stage, but the health and wellbeing of our own species as well. Global climate change threatens human health in numerous and profound ways. Large segments of the population will experience more heat waves, altered exposure to infectious disease, and more-frequent natural disasters. Most significantly, climatic disruption threatens the adequacy of the core "building blocks" of health for large populations around the globe: sufficient food and nutrition, safe water for drinking and sanitation, fresh air to breathe, and secure homes to live in. As climate change dismantles these central elements of healthy societies, people with fewer resources will be forced to migrate in large numbers to lands where they may not be welcome. A likely result of all of these processes will be increased civic instability and strife. Even if the global climate were stable, humans would still be converting more land, water, and ecosystem services for their own now endanger health and wellbeing globally and on scales never experienced in human history. These threats include: exposure to infectious disease, air pollution, water scarcity, food scarcity, natural disasters, and population displacement. Taken together, they represent the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. We need to wake up to the danger and act with urgency to reduce ecological disruption as much as possible while simultaneously strengthening the resilience of populations to withstand the impacts of unavoidable environmental change. Populations vary dramatically in their vulnerabilities to these emerging health threats, in part because the environmental changes that are triggering these threats are not uniform. Rapid glacial melting on the Tibetan plateau threatens the dry-season water supply for more than 1 billion people living and growing irrigated crops in Asia's great river basins. In sub- Saharan Africa, droughts and increased temperatures caused by climate change will interact with existing soil degradation, nutrient loss, and water scarcity to further reduce crop yields and constrain food supplies. The triple threat of more-severe storms, rising sea levels, and degraded coastal barriers-such as mangrove forests, coral reefs, wetlands, vegetated dunes, and barrier islands-will pose significant risks to low-lying coastal populations. But vulnerability is not determined only by a population's exposure to health threats; it is also determined by the ability to adapt in the face of such threats. Many of the threats associated with global environmental change can be mitigated by means of trade, technology, infrastructure, behavior change, philanthropy, and use. The environmental changes from these activities are combining to magnify several public health threats to the extent that they governance. Populations with the resources- both economic and socio-cultural-to engage these mechanisms will suffer less than those without such resources. As a consequence, climate change threatens to further accentuate the divide between rich and poor, both across nations and within them. Because the impacts will depend in large part on a population's location and socioeconomic status, it is critical that all countries conduct rigorous, location-specific risk assessments to identify which populations are at highest risk for which threats. Governments and other stakeholders will also need to mobilize substantial financial resources, technical capacity (both in assessment and appropriate technologies), and new partnerships that can help build capacity over the long term. The health impacts of climate change present an opportunity as well as a challenge. The international community increasingly recognizes the moral imperative to help the poor reduce their vulnerability to climate change- a threat that developing countries have had little role in generating. At the same time, there is renewed emphasis on achieving the United Nations'Millennium Development Goals, as well as increasing attention in the United States to reforming foreign assistance. In this context, climate change may help to shine a light on some of the most entrenched challenges to human health in the poorest countries- including poverty, malnutrition, and infectious disease. For many years, the industrialized world has done less than it could to relieve suffering among the global poor. Now, it will need to vigorously reframe its development assistance to address the impacts of climatic disruption- impacts for which it is largely responsible. With the upcoming climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, the year 2009 may be a defining moment in human history: a year in which the historical injustice of human-induced climate change could fuel an international effort to reduce vulnerability and simultaneously address some of the longest-standing scourges to human health. Our challenge, for the rest of this century and beyond, will be to work to mitigate environmental change (for example, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and to increase the resilience of populations to the impacts of any changes that we are unable to mitigate (such as sea-level rise triggered by past emissions). Neither task should detract from the other; we must pursue both simultaneously and with equal fervor and strategic creativity. Along the way, there will be substantial opportunities to identify co-benefits, whereby a single intervention can both mitigate environmental threats and improve human health. Addressing the health impacts of global environmental change needs to be a priority for the public health community, environmental scientists, and natural resource managers, as well as for governments and intergovernmental bodies such as the United Nations and multilateral development banks. What we need most are political will and financial resources. While these resources will need to be large, they are small compared to the cost of ignoring the impacts of large-scale change and trying to address the overwhelming problems of famine, epidemic disease, massive population displacement, and civil strife that may ensue. © Worldwatch Institute, 2009.},

abstract={Several important risk analysis methods now used in setting priorities for protecting U.S. infrastructures against terrorist attacks are based on the formula: Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Consequence. This article identifies potential limitations in such methods that can undermine their ability to guide resource allocations to effectively optimize risk reductions. After considering specific examples for the Risk Analysis and Management for Critical Asset Protection (RAMCAP™) framework used by the Department of Homeland Security, we address more fundamental limitations of the product formula. These include its failure to adjust for correlations among its components, nonadditivity of risks estimated using the formula, inability to use risk-scoring results to optimally allocate defensive resources, and intrinsic subjectivity and ambiguity of Threat, Vulnerability, and Consequence numbers. Trying to directly assess probabilities for the actions of intelligent antagonists instead of modeling how they adaptively pursue their goals in light of available information and experience can produce ambiguous or mistaken risk estimates. Recent work demonstrates that two-level (or few-level) hierarchical optimization models can provide a useful alternative to Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Consequence scoring rules, and also to probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) techniques that ignore rational planning and adaptation. In such two-level optimization models, defender predicts attacker's best response to defender's own actions, and then chooses his or her own actions taking into account these best responses. Such models appear valuable as practical approaches to antiterrorism risk analysis. © 2008 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract={Information sharing about cyber incidents that affect the normal, safe operation of industrial control systems is not well coordinated or standardized across critical infrastructure sectors of the economy. Consequently there is little situational awareness about the frequency, type and extent of control system cyber incidents - a deficiency with potential national security implications. Control system disruption due to cyber rather than physical means is increasingly a concern of industry and government. More and more control systems utilize commercial off-the-shelf computer technology, and are inter-connected with business enterprise systems and the Internet. Not only are control systems in different sectors interdependent but the commonality of technology means that all sectors face a common cyber threat. These common cyber threats and vulnerabilities present the opportunity for common solutions to be adopted across industry sectors. The solutions include the elimination of vulnerabilities in control system designs and implementations. But with constantly evolving technology and the ever-present threat of cyber attack, tools are needed to support the early detection and timely reporting ofcontrol system cyber incidents. A Raytheon-led team is working in consultation with industry and government to define a standard protocol and data schema for the timely reporting of actual and potential cyber attacks on industrial control systems. Previous efforts to share cyber incident information have encountered barriers, including data confidentiality and detection of novel cyber attack methods. Potential solutions to these barriers and deployment approaches for information sharing tools based on the protocol standard are described. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={A mathematical framework for the risk management of information infrastructures is presented. The framework describes the infrastructure at distinct abstraction layers by integrating four abstract models that describe, respectively, the relation among components due to the implementation, how rights are managed so that they are taken and granted among threat or users, the vulnerabilities and the attacks they enable against, respectively, components and users. Each model corresponds to a distinct approach to formally deduce the rights a threat can achieve on the infrastructure components and its features influence the security properties and the rights that can be acquired through attacks. The framework considers intelligent threats, each trying to achieve one in a set of goals. To this purpose, a threat implements a strategy that compose elementary attacks. Strategies can be discovered and formally represented as a graph or a finite state automaton. Starting from, this formal representation, countermeasures can be considered and analysed so that a proper set of cost effective countermeasures can be applied to define a risk mitigation plan. We show that such a set is always non-redundant because it stops all and only the attacks resulting in a set of goals. Lastly, we show how probabilities of attacks and risk can be considered.

abstract={The continuous growth of cyber security threat s and attacks including the increasing sophistication of malware is impacting the security of critical infrastructure, industrial control systems, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) control systems. The reliable operation of modern infrastructures depends on computerized systems and SCADA systems. Since the emergence of Internet and World Wide Web technologies, these systems were integrated with business systems and became more exposed to cyber threats. There is a growing concern about the security and safety of the SCADA control systems. The Presidential Decision Directive 63 document est ablished the framework to protect the critical infrastruct ure an d the Presidential document of 2003, the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace stated that securing SCADA systems is a national priority. T he critical infrastructure includes telecommunication, transportation, energy, banking, finance, water supply, emergency services, government services, agriculture, an d other fundamental systems and services that are critical to the security, economic prosperity, and social well-being of the public. The critical infrastructure is characterized by interdependencies (physical, cyber, geographic, and logical) and complexity (collections of interacting components). Therefore, information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems without exception. Critical infrastructure disruptions can directly an d indirectly affect other infrastructures, impact large geographic regions, an d send ripples throughout the national an d global economy. For example, under normal operating conditions, the electric power in frastructure requires fuels (natural gas and petroleum), transportation, water, banking and finance, telecommunication, and SCADA systems for monitoring and control. In this paper, we provide an analysis of key developments, architecture, potential vulnerabilities, and security concerns including recommendations toward improving security for SCADA control systems. We discuss the most important issues concerning the security of SCADA systems including a perspective on enhancing security of these systems. We briefly describe the SCADA architecture, and identify t he attributes that increase the complexity of these systems including the key developments that mark the evolution of the SCADA control systems along with the growth of potential vulnerabilities and security concerns. Then, we provide recommendations toward an enhanced security for SCADA control systems. More efforts should be planned on reducing the vulnerabilities and improving the security operations of these systems. It is necessary to address not only t he individual vulnerabilit ies, but the breadth of risks that can interfere with critical operations. We describe key requirements and features needed to improve the security of t he current SCADA control systems. For example, in assessing the risk for SCADA systems, use of general methods for risk analysis including specific conditions and characteristics of a control system need to be applied. Effective risk analysis for SCADA systems requires a unified definition for mishap an d identification of potential harm to safety. As computer systems are more integrated, the distinction between security and safety is beginning to disappear. In bridging the gap between these domains, we propose a unified risk framework which combines a new definition of mishap with an expanded definition of hazard to include the security event. However, methods for risk management that are based on automated tools and intelligent techniques are more beneficial to SCADA systems because they require minimum or no human intervention in controlling the processes. We also identify a unified security/safety risk framework for control systems. Implementing security features ensures higher security, reliability, an d availability of control systems. Thus organizations need to reassess the SCADA control systems an d risk model to achieve in depth defense solutions for these systems. The increasing threats against SCADA control systems indicate that there should be more directions in the development of these systems. Therefore, achieving better quality an d more secure SCADA control systems is a high priority. Information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems with out exception. We conclude with a thought about the future of SCADA control systems. A strategy to deal with cyber attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure requires first understanding the full nature of the threat. A depth defense and proactive solutions to improve the security of SCADA control systems ensures the future of control systems and survivability of critical infrastructure.},

abstract={Recent large scale disasters have awakened governments domestically and overseas to their needs for preparedness to support homeland security and public safety. First responders of various agencies (e.g., fire department, police, EMS) are often on the front line to assist in managing these events to protect lives and property. The effectiveness of their mission is highly dependent on capability of communication systems available at incident scenes. The US Department of Homeland Security has among its top priorities the need for stronger information sharing and infrastructure protection, as well as interoperable communications and equipments. In this paper, we determine key requirements for first responder systems by examining various vulnerabilities and threats in such systems. We investigate implications of interoperable heterogeneous networking, horizontal/vertical communications and various applications on system architecture design.

abstract={In the era of pervasive usage of information and communication technologies in people everyday life, there is a great impulse in the utilities managing critical infrastructures on the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for monitoring and controlling their technical, service and market processes. Inter and intra connected ICT systems, open ICT architectures and shared communication infrastructures have been adopted for information exchange and maintenance purposes by technologically advanced power utilities. They are also becoming a reality in the future ICT applications supporting the remote control of interconnected power infrastructures composed by bulk and dispersed power generation, and the associated power grids. Any standard for ICT security management requires performing security risk assessment. Efforts for adapting these standards to industrial control systems are ongoing. In the electricity sector, two basic research directions on risk assessment have been undertaken: the definition of a vulnerability and risk assessment procedure specific for cyber security and the development of probabilistic approaches to the risk analysis of electrical contingencies. However the emerging frameworks, while allowing a more in-depth analysis with respect to the deterministic approach based on the N-1 criterion, do not cover the evaluation of both contingencies and automation failures, and a comprehensive risk assessment methodology is far from becoming a state of practice. The paper aims at providing a step forward in the cyber security analysis of electric power control systems, introducing the key aspects of a methodology supporting the security evaluation of power utility information systems, as complex interacting infrastructures involving process knowledge, advanced control and information and communication technologies. The methodology is mainly addressed to security technical managers as an offline analysis tool supporting the power system design and planning phases. It may also be used by the security operators as a support tool for security audits and intrusion monitoring activities during the system operation phase, thus contributing at preventing and counteracting the risk of control system degradation or block. The three basic functions of the methodology are: the correlation of security concepts, the computation of security indexes and the consequent evaluation of security failures. The first function of the methodology is to offer a framework of the relevant security concepts the security manager should examine to carry out a correct security analysis. But above all, the methodology traces step by step a logical route inside these concepts in order to obtain an exhaustive and consistent security profile of the system. So through the methodology, the analyst has a method that makes him able to progressively highlight the relevant security aspects of the system under study; at each step, he will be asked to gather only the information which are strictly necessary to clarify on the system the security aspects the step is referred to.},

abstract={Reliable networks are obviously an important aspect of critical information infrastructures. Dolev-Dwork-Waarts-Yung linked research on reliable point-to-point networks with privacy and authenticity. In their threat model the adversary can only take over a number of nodes bounded by a threshold k. Hirt-Maurer introduced the concept of an adversary structure (i.e. the complement of an access structure). Kumar-Goundan-Srinathan-Rangan and Desmedt-Wang-Burmester generalized Dolev-Dwork-Waarts-Yung scenarios to the case of a general adversary structure. Burmester-Desmedt introduced a special adversary structure, now called a color based adversary structure. Their argument in favor of their model is that using automated attacks (such as worms), a vulnerability can be exploited on all computers in the network running the same platform (color). In their model the adversary can control all nodes that use up to k different platforms (or colors). We will demonstrate one of the limitations of their model. Although the family of color based adversary structures has a trivial representation which size grows polynomial in the size of the graph, we will demonstrate in this paper that deciding reliability issues and security issues are co-NP-complete. In most societies censorship is common. Indeed, for centuries it has often been viewed by authorities as an essential security tool. We apply the computational complexity result to study censorship. Authorities may require network designers to demonstrate the capability to censor the internet.

abstract={Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and distributed control systems (DCS) are crucial to the safe and efficient operation of many critical infrastructure components. This is especially true in the oil and gas industries, where DCS are in wide use in the manufacture, processing, and distribution of products. The interconnection of SCADA and DCS, herein referred to as process control systems, or PCS, with corporate networks makes it possible to share information and remote operation of control functions at various locations in a facility, across a corporate network, or at remote locations. In such instances, the PCS is exposed to a set of cyber-related vulnerabilities that have the potential to be exploited by internal and external threats. The cyber-related exploitation of a PCS may pose consequences involving human health and safety, the environment, continuity of business operations, regulatory oversight, corporate liability, and stakeholder perceptions. Decision makers in the oil and gas industry are struggling to determine how secure their system is and how secure it needs to be, as well as how security risks contribute to business risks. Security metrics can help provide answers to these questions. Metrics evaluate aspects of security against a known scale or benchmark. Thus, system security can be described in measurable terms that can aid decision makers and operators in making security-related decisions. Security metrics support the management of cyber risks and the integration of cyber risk management into overall business risk management. The information security community has defined a variety of security metrics. Some are directly and immediately applicable to PCS stakeholders; others could be adapted or tailored to the PCS security problem domain. However, most security metrics activities and resources are not immediately relevant to PCS stakeholders. This paper summarizes initial findings of a research team sponsored by the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection (I3P) to examine existing security metrics and their potential usefulness to PCS stakeholders: industry, PCS vendors and integrators, and government (www.thei3p.org). In this paper we present a brief overview of metrics and how they can be used to evaluate and enhance the security of PCS. We present an overview of existing and developing metrics systems, standards, and scoring tools that have the potential to be applied to PCS in the oil and gas industry. We also describe the challenges and ongoing efforts for developing new metrics tools specifically designed for the evaluation of PCS security and the recommendations provided by industry participants in a workshop sponsored by the I3P in June 2005.

abstract={This paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art overview on power infrastructure defense systems. A review of the literature on the subjects of critical infrastructures, threats to the power grids, defense system concepts, and the special protection systems is reported. The proposed Strategic Power Infrastructure Defense (SPID) system methodology is a real-time, wide-area, adaptive protection and control system involving the power, communication, and computer infrastructures. The SPID system performs the failure analysis, vulnerability assessment, and adaptive control actions to avoid catastrophic power outages. This paper also includes a new concept for bargaining by multiagents to identify the decision options to reduce the system vulnerability. The concept of a flexible configuration of the wide-area grid is substantiated with an area-partitioning algorithm. A 179-bus system is used to illustrate the area partitioning method that is intended to minimize the total amount of load shedding. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={The regulations issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to improve the ability of the nation's critical infrastructure are supported by the Americal Chemistry Council (ACC). The regulations provide security-related information to key government partners without risking unnecessary and potentially dangerous public release. The private sector is encouraged to share and analyze sensitive information with the DHS about threats, vulnerabilities and responses by the regulations. According to Mr. Greg Lebedev, the ACC president, the regulations will increase the ability of public and private sector entities to share critical security related information.},

abstract={Today the vast majority of the world’s information resides in, is derived from, and is exchanged among multiple automated systems. Critical decisions are made, and critical action is taken based on information from these systems. Therefore, the information must be accurate, correct, and timely, and be manipulated, stored, retrieved, and exchanged safely, reliably, and securely. In a time when information is considered the latest commodity, information security should be top priority. A Practical Guide to Security Engineering and Information Assurance gives you an engineering approach to information security and information assurance (IA). The book examines the impact of accidental and malicious intentional action and inaction on information security and IA. Innovative long-term vendor, technology, and application-independent strategies show you how to protect your critical systems and data from accidental and intentional action and inaction that could lead to system failure or compromise. The author presents step-by-step, in-depth processes for defining information security and assurance goals, performing vulnerability and threat analysis, implementing and verifying the effectiveness of threat control measures, and conducting accident and incident investigations. She explores real-world strategies applicable to all systems, from small systems supporting a home-based business to those of a multinational corporation, government agency, or critical infrastructure system. The information revolution has brought its share of risks. Exploring the synergy between security, safety, and reliability engineering, A Practical Guide to Security Engineering and Information Assurance consolidates and organizes current thinking about information security/IA techniques, approaches, and best practices. As this book will show you, there is considerably more to information security/IA than firewalls, encryption, and virus protection. © 2001 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
